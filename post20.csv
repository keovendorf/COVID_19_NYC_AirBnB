The apartment is very cosy and furnished with love. The area Park Slope is full of nice shops and restaurants. The booklet Laurie send us was very useful. Thank you :)"

They have a bird or another animal that makes noises all day long and night. Additionally, every morning it sounded like someone was trying to break down the window in the kitchen - rather disturbing."

The room was cozy, and the apartment was neat. Ssameer gave very clear and detailed instructions on how to get to his place from the airport, so we had no trouble finding it at all. We never personally met Ssameer, but his co-host, Donald was fantastic. Donald was very hospitable and knowledgeable about the area, and he made us feel welcome."

Beautiful home, sparkling spacious room & bath, and so easy to zip over to Manhattan, not to mention all the nearby eateries like LIC Market, LIC corner cafe, grocery & more. So quiet and comfortable, it was a true retreat and restful stay in the city."

"18","13808","621493620",2020-03-31,64139202,"Weiping","原计划入住一个月,因新冠疫情影响,我们只住了半个月,真是非常遗憾,这里位置很好,生活条件卫生都很好,尤其是住在艺术家的老房子里是别样的体验,这是有历史有故事的地方,希望下次再来!"

She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and provide us with everything we could possibly need. 
Her apartment has a lot of personality, and we enjoyed every little detail.

Thank you Charlotte!"

They even were nice enough to store my belongings for longer during the coronavirus situation. The room is spacious for Brooklyn and has nice private bath. All the common areas were kept clean and other guests were respectful. Neighborhood is quiet and safe to walk around. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
"27","26785","623557293",2020-05-01,56460257,"Miguel","My fiance and I stayed at Dani's 2nd floor for a period of 2 months. She lives downstairs with her family so communication with her on any matter was seamless. The apartment is very cozy with a spacious kitchen. All the amenities necessary for our stay were provided by Dani. She happens to be one of the earlier hosts in Brooklyn and all her experience speaks to that fact. The area makes this listing special. Park slope has plenty to offer including Prospect Park less than 10 minutes walk and the F and G similarly close. If you happen to drive as we did, side parking is relatively easy relatively speaking. I would highly recommend anyone to spend a short or long stay at Dani's, you will not be disappointed!"
"28","26933","618073737",2020-03-14,6620870,"Todd","Bruce was great. Communicated well, super helpful, and an easygoing host. The location was great, with numerous food/drink options in easy walking distance."
"29","29683","618779987",2020-03-15,2802971,"Jules","Uli’s place is really nice decorated and clean, as shown in the pictures.
He was flexible as we had our flights delayed and let us stayed few hours more to not stay in the street with ours luggages, i recommand!"
"30","29683","622473820",2020-04-15,151292592,"Andrew","My stay overall was very peaceful. I booked here to have a quiet place to hunker down in for a couple weeks. The kitchen was fully-equipped and the location was right by plenty of grocery stores. The space is very chic and warm. Uli was a very responsive host, and answered all my questions in little to no time."
"31","29683","624825586",2020-05-15,7569639,"Lilly","If you read some of my other reviews, you'll notice that my husband and I have been chronic stay-cationers in NYC, preferring to explore different neighborhoods when we do have the luxury of staying together sporadically. Out of all the Airbnbs that we've had the pleasure of inhabiting, Uli's place was our definite favorite thus far.   First off, as you can see from the photos, the apartment is impeccably decorated, with some very tongue-in-cheek artwork that I'm a huge fan of. The kitchen is fully furnished with high-end labels, and for a month-long stay, we made good use of the calphalon cookware :) There's multiple routes for the coffee-addicted (as we are), in the form of a Nespresso machine, a French press, or an Italian moka pot. And if your preference is to have someone else make your coffee, I highly recommend Lazy Llama, just a short minute's walk down the block.

Prior to check-in, Uli was communicative and ensured that any worries we had about the cleaning and hiccups with check-in were taken care of, and we were able to very easily access KeyCafe to pick up our keys.  During the entire stay, we stayed in touch and he never took more than a few hours to respond.

We are slightly biased because this is our favorite neighborhood, but there's nothing quite like escaping for a walk through Thompkins Square Park, a short jog to the East River promenade, or across the Williamsburg Bridge. Lastly, and most importantly, I was working from home during my stay, and the internet was incredibly reliable for my multiple conference calls and long work days."
"32","31130","627468183",2020-06-02,4106016,"Olga","It was very pleasant experience to stay with Nicole in her cozy and quiet place in the middle of Manhattan. Super convenient location to any corner of New York City. Comfy bed, good size room. 
Place very clean. She is very friendly and helpful host."
"33","32023","619076437",2020-03-16,21625453,"Vera Maria","Khem is the kind of person you want to meet if you are going to NY! We loved the Apartment and the neighborhood."
"34","35526","620241167",2020-03-21,236856998,"Howard","Fantastic Location and wonderful host"
"35","39267","617994624",2020-03-14,202292954,"MaryAnn","In the first place there is a lock box to get into the apartment, through messaging only, we were told that we would receive the code for it before we arrived. However we didn’t and had to wait on the street until we could get the code, which we had to call the housekeeper Michelle for because Marie didn’t answer our calls. As a matter of fact she never once answered our calls. She would just send a message instead, saying she was sorry she missed the call. 

The picture of the apartment is completely deceiving! It is not a bright, sweet apartment nor is it “big” even by New York standards. There are no curtains on the windows instead there are 2 old, dirty rattan blinds. It was almost impossible to open the windows for the fresh air that was desperately needed because of the dank smell in the apartment. 

The entire place was filthy. 
The furniture was old and dirty. Old is ok, but not when it’s too dirty to sit on. The so called futon did not open. It was basically a sofa with a sheet over it. We couldn’t have used it regardless because  underneath the sheet were filthy, stained cushions. I wouldn’t have allowed a dog to sleep on it! Unfortunately it was the only place you could sit to put on your shoes because the rest of the furniture was so old and broken I tried to sit on one chair and it threw me forward.

Fresh linens??? The sheets on the bed smelled bad, definitely not recently washed! We were left two bath towels and they didn’t smell fresh either. The bathroom was so filthy neither of us wanted to even put a towel in there while we showered. We kept the bar of soap we brought on the box that it came in. There was one hand towel in the bathroom but both sides had black dirt on them. (Took pictures) Looked as if someone had used it to dust furniture, but if they had it wasn’t in this apartment. 

As for the kitchen, there were no paper towels or a dish towel. The microwave was so dirty you couldn’t possibly put food in there without a paper plate or paper towel. We tore the lid off our pizza box & used it to warm food. There was dried food (or something!!!) on the kitchen walls, (took pictures), the countertops were filthy & the kitchen was too gross to have cooked in! We were in New York & trying out all the different restaurants is a must!  However if you’re planning on cooking your own meals ... good luck with that! As for the full-size refrigerator, that’s a complete lie. It’s a tiny, dirty refrigerator. It being small wasn’t the problem though, the fact that the seal was so worn out & it wouldn’t close, was! It wouldn’t even keep a bottle of water cold! Within the first hour of being there I made the mistake of trying to take a glass out of the kitchen cabinet. The glass stuck to the dirty contact paper underneath, so we didn’t even use them. The utensils were on top of the refrigerator and were so dirty that when we had to eat off forks I washed them before at least three times. Luckily there was some dish detergent under the sink. 
    After five days, when we ran out of the one roll of toilet paper they’d left, (for a 5 day stay) we contacted the “housekeeper” Michelle. Though she left a note saying that we could contact her 24/7 she was quite rude acting as though she couldn’t believe there was no more toilet paper. When she did bring the toilet paper (after 9pm)she suggested that we could’ve just gone to the CVS on the corner and bought some!! I think toilet paper and paper towels are the minimum that you could put in an Airbnb! Since I had already bought paper plates and a can of Lysol, I wasn’t about to spend another nickel on something that should’ve been there in the first place. We left the paper plates & Lysol for the next poor soul that ends up in this nasty place! 

There is no “dining area”, only a small table with a shelf on the bottom, by the front door. One person couldn’t sit there, let alone two. Finally as for the fresh fruit, we arrived on a Tuesday and when we returned from Time Square on Friday afternoon, there were fruit flies in the fruit. All of it was completely rotted. So I understand that fruit might not be fresh after four days however when there are fruit flies, the fruit is completely rotted!! And underneath that did turn out to be the case. There were no trash bags of course but my daughter happened to find a used one under the kitchen sink. She put the rotted fruit and all of our garbage in there leaving the old bag in the trashcan as there were no more to put in it.
  I wouldn’t recommend this place to a family of monkeys let alone another human being. Check the review from November 2016 by Peter and Teresa. Wish I had checked that far into the reviews. I definitely would not have rented it!"

Usually I don't even see or speak to my hosts other than basic info, but Laurie was extremely helpful in finding good food, directions, even subway help and info about the area. She even stocked the amazing kitchen with organic and very high quality coffee, eggs, bread, deli spreads and bagels which was so helpful as I was a first responder for the Covid crisis and had been worried about food. She shattered any previous standard I had had for an Airbnb host, and the apartment was on the same level. Can't wait to go back for a non-working vacation"
"40","50447","624522987",2020-05-11,96479006,"Hope","Laurie’s place is an overall wonderful, unique experience. The location near prospect park is fabulous, within walking distance to the park. Laurie’s is close to many markets, shops, and restaurants. The area around the home is upscale and safe. The place itself is clean, homey, eclectic. The kitchen is perfect size and has all the amenities you need. Having laundry right there to use is extremely convenient. The bedrooms are large and beds are comfortable. The bathroom is clean and a nice size. The back patio with a garden is STUNNING! There are very few downsides to the place, one being no television. (No big deal in comparison to all the wonderful aspects of this place.) 
Overall, my stay at Laurie’s included comfortable quarters, fantastic location, functional amenities and PHENOMENAL hospitality. I would stay again and I highly recommended!"

It is a cute neighborhood and you have access to her amazing backyard garden. She also provides you with plenty of delicious food for breakfast including croissants, eggs, yogurt and jam. It was the perfect Brooklyn escape for us."

He’s easy-going and fun to talk to, and his boat ride was a total blast. We had just as much fun sipping around the coast as we did seeing the amazing wildlife!"

It was thanks to Tami's idea that we managed to return back home without too much hassle and before the chaos in US airports. I hope to return to Brooklyn and to Tami's place very very soon in a normalized situation where life and travelling can be fully enjoyed again."

It was much more quiet than downtown and the transit was very easy to navigate (lines a,b,c,d & 2 &3 were in close proximity). The decor was minimal but added cute touches. If someone stays in the unit above you, you can hear them moving around (didn’t bother us much as they left on our second day). Laurine is very quick to respond to any concerns or questions & will try to accommodate!"

The weather was nice when I arrived so Lots of neighbors were out enjoying themselves. 

I drove to SI and was able to find street parking. Her place is close to buses, a beautiful park, SI hospital, and local stores in a very culturally diverse and lively neighborhood of Staten Island which I liked a lot. This is what I appreciated the most because it amplified the realness of everyday SI working class and not the “movie” type NYC like Manhattan. 

It’s a clean, convenient affordable room exactly as described. Minimal things in the room which I appreciated, good place to lay your head down after a long day of touring or working. I had no issues whatsoever with others who stayed there and would request another stay in the future."

Quartier très agréable que ce soit en termes de localisation ou de commerces avec tout ce qu'il faut tant au niveau restaurants que supérettes.
Le coronavirus nous forçant à rester confiné, j'ai pu rencontrer et passer du temps avec Adam. C'est un hôte attentionné, disponible et attentif. Il pourra vous donner de bons conseils sur quoi faire/ou aller à NY. En ce qui concerne sa personne, c'est quelqu'un de bienveillant et cultivé, vous aurez à coup sur des discussions intéressantes avec lui.
En termes de transport, compter 10 min pour rejoindre la station de métro la plus proche.
Pour résumé un super séjour malgré le contexte. Merci encore Adam!"

I arrived at Melissa's adorable garden apartment just 7 days before NYC was declared a coronavirus hotspot.  I was scheduled to stay at her place for a month while working on a dream job... and then my job was cancelled.  Melissa was very cooperative in dealing with Airbnb and making sure that we could cancel the reservation and that I could see a refund for the unused time.  I am very grateful.  The apartment has everything you need for a longer stay and is situated in the fantastic neighborhood of Carroll Gardens.  I wished I could have stayed longer!!!!

Nice little gym on the top floor (free). Less than 5min walk to the 2/3 express and 4 local metros, which are the most important to get around time. Also 3min walk to Central Park for walking and running. Good supermarket only one block away and large Target shopping centre in walking distance. While technically located in Spanish Harlem and close to various ""projects"", the immediate area feel generally safe (after a bit getting used to)."

The location in Williamsburg is amazing, close to lots and lots of cosy cafes, awesome restaurants and quirky shops! The stay was perfect, we had everything we needed in the apartment and if we needed anything Adrienne was always quick and happy to help! In the mornings we could hear the foot steps from above, but we had already been warned, and we didn't find it annoying. We had planned to stay four weeks but had to leave after two weeks because of the outbreak of the corona virus... But our two weeks were fantastic and if we're ever back in NYC again we would stay here again and I would recommend it to anybody!"

Apple TV, Netflix and Bluetooth speaker helped on rainy days. The location is great, Saint Marks is a very hip place, a lot of young people and a very busy place which is why I love it. Easy to get around since the metro is literally 3 minutes away. Great restaurants just a step out the door, or if you just want a quick 1$ slice pizza, two bro’s is just to your right when coming out the building. A noisy neighborhood, but that’s why I chose this place. Not too much noise in the actual apartment, but the building has no elevator so keep that in mind! Also, this apartment is full of personal items such as family photos, clothing etc, which some people don’t appreciate but personally I had no problem with it. Kyle was an absolute sweet heart and is really quick with replies and super helpful, especially in this whole chaos that is the Corona virus meaning I had to cancel 3 nights which was no problem and I got a full refund. Love love love, will probably book again when coming back! Highly recommend <3"

This unit is located on the fourth floor but  is clearly represented in the description in every other way. The host is prompt, friendly, and responsive to all messages. It’s a rear-facing unit (the windows face south) so you’ll not hear the late night carrying on of the bars and restaurants of St Marks Place(not that that was a thing during our COVID lockdown stay) but you will hear the chatter and partying in the courtyards that sit behind the property. It’s not a knock on the unit, it’s a feature of living in NYC. The ac unit neutralizes the outside noise and does a great job keeping the unit comfortable. 

For downtime, there is a nice flat screen tv equipped with Apple TV and a digital antenna. WiFi works great. Kitchen is equipped with above average pots pans utensils. Teapot and French press coffee maker is simple and effective means of getting your daily caffeine. Good hot water and water pressure. 

Except for the thigh busting climb of 60+ stairs, this unit is just as described, and in a great part of NYC. Clean, no bugs and a great host."

Our small group of 5 people quickly got in touch with Tony via a (Hidden by Airbnb) group where we could all ask questions and talk to our host.  Tony was responsive, helpful and friendly.  He was there to give us the right tips to best prepare our trip, always ready to find out what we could get out of it.  He regularly sent us photos and videos of his neighborhood to give us a taste of what our ""home"" would be like for a week.  Unfortunately the pandemic context made us have to cancel our trip and consequently our stay at Tony's house.  Once again, he was accommodating and understanding and the cancellation was made under optimal conditions.  As this is only a postponement, we have postponed our trip to a later date and we will be going to Tony's house!  Many thanks to you Tony for your help and understanding!

Because Desmond and Rodney have given me the best hospitality I've never felt such as 'home' even compared to renting a high-rise apartment in Brickell, Miami. If it's possible for me to extend as long as I am going to be in New York, I will not look further for other Airbnb listings out there. The furnitures suit well with Bed-Stuy's vintage aesthetics and they are all comforting you while having your work at home. As Desmond and Rodney are always responsive thru text, they always keep you informed if anything happens and offered with any inquiries. This is the key of feeling as if I'm 'home', by having the hosts to make sure you are comfortable during the stays. Outside the stays, the neighborhood is where I've always wanted to be since I was a little kid somewhere in Indonesia. Fortunately, the laundry and grocery store are only two blocks away, so you'd feel safe even during the lockdown. But focus on the stays itself, it's not easy to find hosts like Desmond & Rodney!"

In fact, I would normally just not say anything at all  if I had nothing good to say . However, this host had ample opportunity to redeem himself or at least TRY to fix or acknowledge the situation. But Instead, he remained  non-chalant about our concerns.  Ignored the few text messages I sent him but one (which was a request for some heat which he responded to a few hours later but still did not turn on the heat. So we just bundled up for the night .)  Thank God we were hardly ever home. We spent an entire day and night at another location and also checked out of the apartment a day earlier than planned . 
 

We were in NY, not on vacation, but for a solemn family occasion.  We had booked about 2 weeks in advance though.
On arrival, the bathroom had not been cleaned at all , and there were no supplies for us to use to clean it ourselves . So, we ended up going out to purchase cleaning supplies including basics  paper towels ( he later explained that he does not supply paper towels which is fair enough ).....  I had sent  the him pictures of the  soiled sink, soiled toilet bowl and rim , dirty bathroom  floor rug, dirty floors  and a bizarrely soiled roll of toilet paper ( the bottom of the roll had multiple brown stains on it! !) 

He did not respond to my text with pictures, nor to a phone call for over 36 hours.  Next day, after my husband cordially spoke to him in person, there was no reaction except that he promised to come right back with  some toilet paper which he finally gave to us 2 days later.  He also said that the soiled toilet paper that we found in the bathroom had been  left by the last guest! We were not sure how that made it ok but we decided not to ask anymore questions at that point .

Utensill drawer in kitchen was dirty with a random needle in it  (we left it there as is ) . Floors in apartment had not been mopped and bare feet meant dirty feet!  I was able to hand mop the  bathroom floor and we wore indoor flip flops throughout .  Tables and side tables were literally unwiped and were dusty.  

We had no internet for almost 2 days !! Host was not even apologetic and did not respond to our text asking for internet connection until over 36 hours later. 

Other than all the above , it was a peaceful stay. Great location, central to everything, which could easily have made this a  5 star review !! We are not at all fussy but just expected a clean, warm place with internet connection.  We totally understand that things happen and can get missed , BUT, this hosts reaction ( or lack thereof) was very dissapointing :( 
I would have skipped leaving such a long review had he even made an attempt to be hospitable by providing the basics or even an apology, an explaination, something??? 
 
We left a day early. Tidied up the place, took out the trash ( he had left zero trash bags for us by the way, even though we had asked for some.  So, we simply sourced our own bags for trash each day.  ) 

I had  sent him a message letting him know that we were leaving, he was home , but as usual,  no response .
-sigh-"

I believe his wife Hannah is who was extremely rude btw. Just want to put that out there.  Now let’s get right into the review. At first I thought this was a nice peaceful private space for my husband and I to get away but boy was I wrong. We originally checked in on Friday and was going to leave Monday but due to a change of plans we had to extend our stay to Thursday. During my stay there I noticed that there were mice droppings behind the coffee machine on the kitchen table. I also saw several mice running  around the kitchen in the evening . I had no idea that this apartment was infested with mice.  Also the garbage can  in the kitchen wreaked of a garbage land fill. The kitchen was so ill-smelling that I had to hold my nose every time I wanted to use the bathroom or shower because the toilet and shower were both in the kitchen. There are so many horrific incidents that took place during my stay.  I’m just naming a few.  Here’s one on my way out the door with my 2 year old son there was a drug attic on the steps in the hallway. I was so frightened that I ran upstairs to grab a knife. I couldn’t believe that the door wasn’t secure enough for this to happen.  I was going to call the cops but I managed to scare the guy away by showing him my knife. Thank God he did not return but that definitely was a scary situation that could have gone left quickly. I explained to Hannah all of my concerns and she didn’t do anything to resolve the issues.  She offered to call the cops when I notified her of the drug attic on the property. I feel a more serious action was needed such as doing something to make the door more secure. What if that man would have hurt me? God forbid. What if he comes back and hurts the next person who rents? And as far as the filth she just apologized and told me her cleaning lady would be there Thursday, the day I was checking out. If your place is not up to par or you have a mice or any bug infestation you should not be renting it out. And that brings me to my last issue; when I got home today I discovered bed bug bites all over my 2 year old son.  I do not recommend this place to anyone who values cleanliness. This place is not for you so don’t book. Trust me!"

Perfect place to be, since it is in the heart of East Village with lots of restaurants and bars what also do take out. I recommend Maya Mezcal witch is right downstairs. They have amazing margaritas and very good tacos.   
The host Seith was very helpful and nice when we had some questions.  I definitely recommend this place to stay!"

L'emplacement est parfait pour découvrir Williamsburg à pied, mais aussi pour se rendre à Manhattan rapidement (le East River Ferry est une très bonne option en plus du métro). 
Je remercie encore une fois Ali, qui a préparé un pdf très clair pour arriver jusqu'à l'appartement, pour s'occuper de Sweetpea et en plus avec plein de recommandations d'endroits à tester dans le quartier. C'est une super hôte qui est disponible par (Hidden by Airbnb) et qui a tout fait pour que notre séjour (au moment très particulier du début de la pandémie...) se passe au mieux.  J’aimerais bien  y revenir dans d'autres circonstances !"

The location is great, it's within walking distance to the subway and I was able to commute by subway to my job in lower Manhattan in about 40 minutes door to door. The apartment is within short walking distance to two neighborhood dog parks, plenty of restaurants, bodegas, and a couple of small supermarkets. There's a lot of activity in the area so I never felt uncomfortable walking around even when I had to take the dog out late at night. You can hear some outside noise in the apartment but Tiffaney provides two white-noise machines. However, I didn't bother using them and I had no trouble sleeping. The kitchen has just about everything you need and it was easy to make simple meals. It's a small apartment but all the rooms are good size and there is plenty of space, and it really was very clean. The internet worked just fine and there's a TV with all the channels. The parking space and use of the washer/dryer made my stay super easy and convenient.  Check in was smooth even though I ended up arriving pretty late, and Tiffaney was always very accommodating and responsive.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the place to others."

From there, you can go on a 5-mile hike or bike ride along the coast, past several restaurants, playgrounds, and beaches, all the way to the Great Kills Park.

It is so peaceful and silent the entire day! You also have the beach near so you can go clear your mind and, if you need action, you'll hop on the A train and go eat a hamburger under the pretty lights or wonder around NYC until 10PM if you like.

If you need groceries, go to the Cuban's store, it's budget friendly and they have those delicious $0.9 mini cherry pies in a box. 

Have fun."

The noise levels were very high. The original description didn’t really indicate that her 2 year old grandson would be running around until midnight/1am. It was very hard to sleep. I know a few other guests left immediately due to the noise. The house carries noise so it’s hard if people are moving around the home late at night. Other than that, I have no complaints. 

It is always hard to stay at places where other guests can come, the kitchen is small so hard to share the space. Carol, is a great hostess and did her very best to make things nice for my time."

Sadly my 5 weeks stay was only 5 days as with Broadway shut down and everything I was there for cancelled. Also had to fly back as airspace was being closed down and as diabetic - I wanted to be back home. 

However for the short time I was there - Betsy was absolutely amazing - doing everything she could to make me feel welcome and then went out of her way to help accommodate and assist me with getting back to the UK. 

The apartment is so well located and was an easy walk to Time Square and a great walk to 70th and down to 30th (sadly was as far a I was able to roam. 

The apartment is great value for money and my real regret is not being able to have spent  the full time there - I shall return! 

Thanks Bestsy and in turn Michael!"

The area was safe, lots of bars,restaurants, parks, walking distance to subway and major public transportation. Best part was that he was dog friendly!  Despite the Covid orders, plenty of local businesses, provided amazing lunch and dinner specials. Not only is Emmett an excellent host, he makes a RAD, pizza! Visit his pizza shop, Emmett’s, less than a mile from the apartment, you will NOT regret the choice. I recommend the Big Papi pizza. You’ll thank me later!

The location is amazing right near McCarren Park in Williamsburg, you couldn’t be in a better spot. It’s just a short walk to the L train (10 mins into Manhattan) and the neighbourhood and streets around the apartment feel really safe with loads of restaurants and bars nearby. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you could need to cook and also tea, coffee etc which was a nice touch. The bed was really comfy too. I was concerned from a couple of previous reviews that there wouldn’t be enough space to store clothes etc but there is a big wardrobe and a set of drawers as well as a cupboard to stow away your suitcases so we found it to be plenty of space. I would 100% recommend this apartment as an amazing place to stay in Williamsburg and Brooklyn!"
"203","293837","619244379",2020-03-16,229672,"Claudia","This is the first time I am writing a negative review but never did I end up in such a situation. The place was extremely dirty. Was cleaned a bit on the surface but everything else was full of dust, dirty tissues, ear plugs, feathers was extremely unhealthy. I ended up with breathing issues at night because of the amounts of dust. Fridge also not cleaned and full of perishable food, no exchange sheets for the bed ( I was supposed to stay one month). Host was giving no proper solutions, suggested I should buy swiffers when I asked for a vacuum cleaner. Or broom. That kind of dirt was requiring much more than a swiffer. Same for laundry, she promised a solution and never came back to me. The other guest that I was supposed to share with decided to stay with relatives because of the hygiene issues.
I tried to solve the issue on my own and not ruin all my time in my trip on trying to get something from the host that came across not really interested in the situation she created but the covid pandemic occurred and at this point the place became a threat to my health and my safety. Informed by airbnb on this specific reservation that I am entitled to a full refund due to the covid pandemic and lock down and because I could not risk to get quarantined or sick in a place with hygiene issues that already caused me health problems, I left the place two weeks earlier under 2 extenuating circumstances: covid pandemic, and big hygiene issues on a pandemic requiring extreme care on that matter. I wrote the host about the situation and my departure and she never replied. I wrote her again a few days after, still no reply.  In such a critical global situation and after literally jeopardising people health and stay with literally no care being taken on her duties as a host I would expect a reaction, an explanation and a solution."

Majar is a great host: easy to communicate with, there for you if you have trouble, overall great in making you feel safe and making you feel that someone is there if needed. We had to leave hastily and he could not have been better about it.

"233","421554","622418424",2020-04-14,343033902,"Kathryn","Here are the details, not option about what happened with this bad experience.
My friend and I are nurses who came to help Brooklyn hospital with the covid crisis. My flight was changed and I ended up with a direct flight, which brought me in early. Check in is at 3pm and I got there at about noon. He was still cleaning the apartment and asked me to wait until he was done, so I waited outside the address listed. After sitting outside for an hour in the rain, he called me to another apartment a few doors down. Here’s what I found...
The furniture is not at all what it is in the pictures. The sofa looks like he pulled it off the street. It was a dirty futon with hair and dirt in the cup holders. It had NO CUSHION in it. It was so uncomfortable that sitting in it made our backs hurt.  The beds are not the same. They’re low to the ground and covered in plastic mattress protectors, so it was sweaty and sticky.  The chairs in the rooms are not the same. They’re small, but clean. 
The bathroom pictures were not of the actual bathroom. The wooden shelves are not there. Instead it looks like a small medicine cabinet with loose shelves.  It looks like the door broke so there’s a little curtain there. 
The stove and stove hood were covered in splattered oil. 
The back yard does not look like the pictures. The chairs and furniture were not out there. The host didn’t have anything to say about it either. 
We planned on being there for two months so we cleaned up and used pillows to try to make the sofa comfortable. On day 3 we went to work at the hospital. It was raining that day and we came home to a puddle in the back room. There was a leak in the roof and it leaked all over the floor in the back room, all over the luggage. We sent a message to the host and he said when it dries up, he would send someone out. This was the last straw and we decided to leave. We contacted him to let him know we were leaving. He was rude and hung up on us. We had two packages delivered from family and he never contacted us about them. We did leave in a hurry since it was late and we had to work the next day, so we left some medication and surgical masks, along with a UVC light sterilizer. We asked him about it and he left the medication in a bag near the front door. He kept everything else. He hasn’t returned any messages. He won’t respond to AirBnb about it either."

The apartment was exactly as advertised and what we needed - simple, clean, and easy as far as location, having laundry in the basement and easy going neighbors. Seth was very responsive and flexible with us as well. When we let him know that  there was a chance we would need to extend our stay, he made sure to check in with us before releasing dates. He also provided a new quality mattress for the main bedroom during our stay which was a nice upgrade and also allowed us to bring in a bunkbed for our kids. It really worked out for us."

My first day there, unbelievably, I totaled my truck in Brooklyn and was ambulanced to the hospital and did not have keys to get back into my place. Jodi sent a key In the middle of the night to help us. Jodi has helped us out with so many things throughout our stay. I can never say enough about her hospitality and Generosity. Not to mention, that this place is awesome.  The location is incredible and we love it so much. You can't find a better neighborhood in NY for safety, convenience, and cool vibe.  a short walk down to the water taxi at the river and so many cool places to explore.

The place is spacious, cozy, warm and bright, it just feels like home. It has everything you'll ever need to make your stay comfortable to the max. The location is amazing as well, it's both quiet and green (no morning noise and traffic), all while being right off Bell boulevard, where one can find plenty of bars and restaurants. Not to mention just a short walk to the LIRR, if one desires to easily visit the city. Your privacy is always respected, but Amy and Renee will always be available if you should need anything.

She goes out of her way to make you feel home. At the same time she has the ability to perfectly balance between being present and supportive and giving you all the room and privacy you need to feel as you were in your own apt. I immensely appreciated the time together and tours around the city. Regarding the room, I spent significant time there home working (due to COVID19) and I felt really comfortable. The room is very well furnished and decorated, and I didn't miss anything. You have your own bathroom and the weekly cleaning is also great. I was mostly cooking myself as the kitchen has all the appliances and utensils you would need. The apt. is located in a relative recent building facing a park and the neighbourhood felt secure (I was walking a lot). Also you will find supermarkets and all sort of shops and restaurants 2 steps away. There is also a very conveniently located subway station.

It’s in a cool neighborhood, and one I enjoy, but the problems started right away with the wrong address on the listing, which meant packages, like me, went to the wrong address. Not a single piece of furniture matched the photos. The grills were gone. So were the stools when I arrived; I had to ask for them so I had someplace to sit and eat. Richard brought them, but you have to sit on them like you’re riding a horse to eat at the counter. The kitchen has some nice appliances, but the fridge is leaky; when I opened a drawer it poured freezing water all over my feet. One day the desk chair broke; I had to put screws back in with my fingers. There were no lamps in the apartment, which meant that reading was impossible and that hard overhead lighting was my only option at night. The wifi was garbage, kept coming in and out in the middle of television or any sort of normal activity. Nice to have a TV, but the wifi is so bad I gave up after a few nights. I haven’t had wifi like that since the 2000s. The sheets were cheap, worn and came off the bed every night, which I had never experienced in my life. The “new” sofa which replaced the bedroom chairs in the photos was falling apart, chipping off leather, and felt like it would break at any moment. The little leather crumbs soon filled the apartment. There were no cleaning supplies like a broom, so I had to just leave it like that. The “new” living room couch was cheap and uncomfortable. My first morning I woke up to see the kitchen filled with ants. Richard brought some traps, but the problem persisted. There was no recycling bin. There were no mixing bowls in the kitchen, etc. It felt like every day here brought a new frustration, all the way to checkout, on which Richard was completely inflexible, meaning I had to wait seven hours at the airport before my flight. There are positives; the place has nice architectural details and is in a nice neighborhood. It could actually be nice with better furniture (like in the photos?), some lamps, furniture on the deck, better wifi, functional sheets, etc. it honestly feels like this place could be decent with a minor amount of investment and some thought. But as it is now it felt cheap and exploitative. Worst experience I’ve had on airbnb."

Her thoughtfulness and hospitality throughout my stay made my time in her apartment all the more enjoyable.  I was a guest at Catrinel's apartment at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in NYC, and she consistently checked in on me to see how I was settling in and to see if there was anything I needed that she could mail to me.  

I felt completely at home in the space, which was airy, bright and very spacious.  The building was clean and quiet, and the surrounding neighborhood was lovely with a variety of independent shops, restaurants, wine shops and grocery stores, though most had limited service due to the pandemic.  Catrinel's apartment is well-connected with easily accessible public transportation right outside the front door, so getting around the city was quite easy.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Catrinel's apartment and would stay there again in a heartbeat!"

Exploring the city by foot was also very doable as it’s located in a great location in East Village. 

Adam and his Superintendent deserve many accolades as they were both extremely kind and helpful. Anything that I needed or any questions I had were responded to quickly. I can’t thank them enough for what they did for me during my month stay. Adam really cares about his guest and his hospitality was much appreciated.

Further, the only lock you have is to your rooms door and it could easily be broken into. There were also mice in the apartment and they ate through some of our food.

When any little question, concern, issue, Rickie was immediately responsive and addressed my needs. 
If I return there for work, I would try to return to this Airbnb."

The location and its connectivity to every part of manhattan city can be a plus point for people who are having a short visit to NY. As, it can save a lot of time. The neighborhood is quite and safe.

The host is very responsive which meant any questions we had during our stay were answered promptly. The check-in and check-out process using Key Cafe around the corner was also very easy. The location is also quite central to most places. We avoided subways because of COVID and took an Uber everywhere and it was fairly cheap to do so from this place. 

Only con I think of, the apartment sort of 'rumbles and hisses' all day and night.. I guess this comes with it being pre-war building. 

Overall, a really good stay! Thanks for hosting us Megan!"

The neighborhood was great and close to all types of restaurants, coffee shops and most importantly Prospect Park - ideal location for the times that I did walk around to get some fresh non-covid air. The apartment itself had everything I needed and tons of natural light that came pouring into the living room where I set up my little home office.

We stayed for a week and didn't feel like we were intruding nor were we lacking privacy. 
Jhon also provided us with all necessities and more. 

The apartment is not huge but well organised. There was enough room for us to store our clothes in the closet. The bed is comfortable.
It was very clean everywhere.

The two cats are lovely and like to be pet.

The location is also very good, only 1 min walk from the 103rd street station on the 6th subway line and probably less than 10 min walk to central park. they are lots of local shops very close in case you need anything.

The only drawback of the place might be the nearby train line. If you are a light sleeper, you might want to use earplugs.

Overall, this is an excellent place to stay for a week."

The host messaged me in a rude way to notify me about a noise complaint from the neighbors. I have stayed at many different listings with Airbnb and I never had a host message me in such an unprofessional way like Camille did, especially over a misunderstanding. Camille messaged me accusing me of “partying” and being totally disruptive to the neighbors when in reality I was alone and just happened to fall asleep with the radio on. I apologized for the radio, It was a mistake. I’ve never had any issues with the places I’ve stayed at but I was completely shocked to see how rude and aggressive a host can be! I understand that neighbors can be melodramatic, and clearly this host had some issues with this in the past but that doesn’t give them the right to be rude to me when they simply could’ve voiced their concerns in a more professional way. As a host you should be making your guests feel as comfortable as possible since they are paying for a homey experience! Definitely won’t stay here again. For those wondering about the actual apartment, be aware that the bathroom does not have a working lock, extremely terrible WiFi/service and dusty floors."

The neighborhood is safe and Flatbush Ave is a 2 min walk with groceries, laundry, pizza and deli very close. The park is also close and is a great place to walk or ride bikes with scenic views.

He is a great and friendly host and his place is very clean and convieniently located near the subway and bus station . He gives amazing local tips to visit in and around nyc . There are plenty of grocery stores , restraunts , pharmacy , laundromats etc located near his home. Also there is an indian grocery store just 10 mins by walk . The place is very safe . It is also a great stay for medical students who want to do rotation in nyph or mmc . Highly recommend. I look forward to stay at his place again when i visit nyc/brooklyn."

Elisabeth was a wonderful host, incredibly accommodating and kind. The location is central to train lines that get you downtown pretty fast. You are right by central park, morningside park, and the river—who knew you could be around so much nature in Manhattan. There are plenty of grocery stores, bodegas, restaurants, bakeries, and cafes around the area. Having excellent restaurants just downstairs and the Hungarian Pastry shop and insomnia cookies across the street is a huge advantage. Don't hesitate to book. This place is an absolute gem! I will definitely be coming back. Thank you, Elisabeth!"

Her place was in ideal location. We really enjoyed grabbing our daily morning nitro cold brew at the Coffee Project and delicious lox bagels at Ross & Daughters.  When arriving, be ready for a third floor walk up with narrow stairs. This might be tough for those with larger luggage. There is also odor of cannabis in the halls so not recommended to those who are sensitive to this. It was on the louder side in the apartment and out in the streets during our stay but this is as expected with it being NYC! We allowed ourselves to just fully immerse in the New York lifestyle during a long weekend.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in a very vibrant NY neighborhood. Thank you to our great host!"

It was a blessing that I was staying here when the pandemic hit NYC. The location is extremely close proximity to public transport and essentials, and she has all the amenities you could ask for during a long-term stay. Kayla is such a kind and considerate host, and her communication skills and charisma are unmatched. She was such a great roommate, and I couldn't have asked for a better place during this global crisis. This is also a safe space and LGBTQIA+ positive, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Check-in was a breeze; the apartment was spotless; and it had everything I could need for a longer stay. The kitchen was well-stocked with pantry essentials and cookware so you can spend time cooking in the apartment versus going out to eat all the time. There are also several grocery stores within walking distance (Trader Joe's, Morton Williams, D'Agostino's, etc.) The apartment is equipped with WiFi, a small office area, and a TV that has access to Amazon and Netflix. The apartment is also in a prime location - it's less than a 10-minute walk to Madison Square Park where there are several subway stations nearby. There were a couple minor hiccups throughout my stay, but Shayne was also very responsive, communicative, and apologetic. He always made sure to find a solution quickly and always did what's best for me. I couldn't ask for a better host or a better place to stay at during my time in New York. Thank you, Shayne!"

Super attentive and available whenever was needed. And the space felt like home away from home. One of the best areas in classic Brooklyn where you will have easy access to anything you may need.  I was able to cook my meals while “working from home” with plenty of creative inspo surrounding me. On days I would look out into the back garden and count hidden sculptural finds. Tres cool!  Highly recommend this great stay and experience !!!!  Thank you Lucien !"

Very clean, comfortable bed and lovely kitchen. The location is incredibly convenient to downtown Brooklyn and other popular locations.
A charming space for two and we cooked breakfast and dinner every day. Enough space to spend the entire day relaxing inside.
There is a laundromat and a cute little market that you can see just outside the window.
Will most definitely be returning. (Thank you, Lucien!)"

Clean hardwood floors and restaurants and coffee and corner stores within walking distance.  The floors are really thin and we could hear running early in the morning and coffee grinding late at night. So, house noise was a bit of an issue.  Also, pillows and mattress weren't great and there was no central heat or good insulation just space heaters. The train to Central Park took an hour and we didn't realize it would be that far. The neighborhood is starting to be gentrified but still has a lot of it's own character. Overall, a good experience but some things would have made it better."

Zach and Rachel were so great and communication the whole time. Super easy to check in even when I arrived at 3am. 
The flat is in an ideal location for prospect heights. Just off Washington ave with lots of bars, cafes and grocery shops. 10 mins walk to Brooklyn museum and prospect park, so so nice! And really well connected - 3 different subway stops no more than 10 mins walk away. 

The whole place is a great size, so much more room than you would get in Manhattan. Comes with loads of laundry and towels and super clean bathroom. There's a 24/7 laundromat next door which is ideal for a longer term stay to wash your clothes. 

Thanks so much for an amazing stay, I can't wait to come back to NYC and hopefully propsect heights again!"

She was something like a friend who needed her plants watered and mail checked, so something more akin to a house-sit than an Airbnb stay. If that is fine with you then you will love this place! I imagine that she will make some changes from my stay, so any issues I had about the space, I anticipate she will make it better for the next round. The location is great. It’s super close to the train. The space isn’t actually a one-bedroom, but more like a studio with a separate kitchen and a makeshift bed area. The WiFi is fast and the little fridge was surprisingly spacious. The key drop off was clunky and unsuccessful but it was also around the time of COVID planning and quarantine so my ability to travel and mail was limited. For the price, it was a really great stay and folks who are into vintage and make-shift will feel right at home."

seriously there's nothing holding me back with the amenities and both Desmond and Rodney for giving such warm solutions out of everything I ask for. Literally everything.

Extremely helpful and communicative. From the beginning he assured me that he had steamed surfaces and cleaned and even added a virus filtering fan into his apartment to make us feel safer given the current circumstances. He met us from a distance with a mask on and gave us an awesome tour and explained so many cool little things I never would’ve otherwise learned about the area. 
As for the apartment? Amazing. NY Airbnbs are notorious for looking way better/bigger in pictures than in real life but Giovannis DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Very spacious for a NY apartment, very clean and bright, just the absolute coolest little apartment and old school feel with modern artsy decor. There are endless knick knacks and cool things you’ll find throughout your stay spread out all over the apartment. Huge bedroom and it’s a good long hallway to the pullout couch so if you have multiple people they will be sleeping nice and separate. We even made a small mistake and Giovanni was very forgiving and understanding. I could go on and on but just know I usually find at least one downside and there was not one here: fantastic location, amazing price, awesome host you cannot go wrong! Book it! And the perfect place to stay during these times as it’s just far enough out of the hustle and bustle but a quick ride to the city if you choose. Thank you again Giovanni, we can’t wait to come back!"
"577","1304459","627345230",2020-06-01,210256026,"Julian","I stay in a lot of Airbnbs and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur (I became location free and live/ work in them, a month at a time). 

I stayed in this apartment for two weeks during NYCs lockdown (which at the time of writing is still going on, but hopefully, by the time you're reading this will be one of those weird times in history). 

The apartment: this was one of my favourite apartments I’ve stayed in. Pamela and Paco have a real sense of style - right from the building’s stairs you’ll see artwork (some of which I believe to be their own) on the walls, wood and iron furniture and an entire wall of books to thumb through (something I spent a lot of time doing). The sound system they have installed is amazing (but not bluetooth - make sure you bring your iPhone adapter). The apartment itself is pretty quiet, though you will hear the occasional car blasting loud music from the street outside. The bed is also really comfortable. 

The highlight, though, was the kitchen - one of the best I’ve had the pleasure of cooking in. The Viking stove is fantastic, and everything I needed was available. There was plenty of desk space to work on (I work from home, so this is important for me). And the media space (comfortable chairs, Apple TV) was a welcome addition considering there’s nothing open right now in NY. Sadly the cats weren’t home when I was here, so I can’t really comment on them.

The location: there's a good supermarket and pharmacy just across the road. The pizza place next door was fantastic. There are also some great Deli’s really close to the apartment, and quite a few restaurants (as almost nothing was open at the time I was there, I can't say much about them). A bit further away you can easily walk to Mccarren Park (10 to 15 mins), and an area with lots of bars and shops (I forget the name of the street).

 In a nutshell: highly recommended."

There are many nice amenities in the apartment upstairs, including a full kitchen and idyllic living space that is perfect for relaxing after a fun day in the city. It is very close in proximity to several subway stations, making it easy to get anywhere in NYC in a reasonable amount of time. Also close by is Prospect Park, a beautiful place to go for a run on the 3ish mile surrounding track or just to enjoy some beautiful wooded areas. There are many books to enjoy inside on a rainy day, and the hosts have great recommendations on things to do around the city.

This caused us problems as people on the street yelled and argued all night, keeping us awake most of the night each night. We never got a good night sleep. That and the cleaning issue gave us alot of trouble. Anyone that stays here needs to check out the neighborhood before they book the place. They also need to make sure the place is clean.

The bedroom is nice and spacious with a smart TV , which is where we spent all of our days. The kitchen was clean and equipped with pots, pans and plenty of baking pans, cooking utensils, plates, etc. If you are planning on cooking home cooked meals I suggest bringing your own desired condiments (oil, salt, pepper), I have a habit of bringing my own which is why it was no problem for me. Overall, the space was nice and cozy, and its in a great area. Zev was also responsive to the questions that we had. We are looking forward to staying here again, if it is ever available. Definitely recommend. Thank you again Zev!"

If you book here be mindful to bring your own coffee, toothpaste and stuff like that. The wifi acts up a bit. There was a minor leak coming from the ceiling in the bathroom just over the sink. But you can tell Zev takes really great care of his place and he cares about your stay. So enjoy and thanks!"
"593","1399448","624438395",2020-05-10,221938042,"Julio","The value is the best thing about this apartment. I stayed during Quarantine so prices were very low. The location is a block away from a Whole Foods, its close to parks and subway stops. Overall the apartment itself is well maintained. The bathroom needs some work. During my stay there was a buck collecting water dripping from he ceiling that was concerning. The Host asked for a photo and never mentioned it again. The kitchen was reason, it was a bit tight but I love how he had everything you need in a kitchen. Pots, pans, gas stove top, oven, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, and other crucial utensils. I was very pleased with the kitchen set up. The fridge was super clean and new. 

Now one of the MAIN reasons why I booked this apartment was to work. The ENTIRE stay I did NOT have a solid internet connection. New York had a stay in place order, WIFI is EVERYTHING, especially when your are trying to work from home. This was something I addressed to the host on my first day. I appreciate his attempt to solve the problem but I had to jump through hoops to help him out and the issue was never resolved. He offered to refund me $30 out of the $572.00 (at first) I already paid, it was insulting. I spent an entire day waiting for two different cable guys. Not only did I have to help him in my own apartment I had to give him access to a secondary apartment the Host owned. I was temporary landlord without any type of reasonable compensation to do so. The cable guy came by twice ultimately confirming that the issue was not with the cable company but the Host's faulty wiring. The Host expressed how expensive it would be to change and they he couldn't do much about it. He was not empathic nor offered a real solution to get me up and running. I still had 3 days of work left so the majority of my stay I had to go to my office to work out of which was unreasonably inconvenient

The last negative thing was that is located in front of a soup kitchen. You are woken up by many loud homeless people in front of the building. I felt safe but the noise was an issue throughout the day. The soup kitchen attracts homeless people to hangout in front of the building the entire day. Some of them sleep outside and cause ruckus at night time. .

Overall my stay was pleasant and the Host agreed to pay me $100 to accommodate the inconveniences. I had to pry it out of him but that was the best he can do due to the fact that he is out of work. I sympathetically worked with him. If this were any other host and circumstances I would have gotten at least half if not a full refund. Remember the principle reason I was there was to work and I was unable to work. I appreciate his overall willingness to give something back but I was not happy about the outcome. I wish him well in the future. 

PS
If you are looking to be close to soho and lower east side night life, this would be a great place to stay. NO PARTIES, this is a family friendly building."

It's been an absolute BLESSING being able to call this my home and getting to know Cristie. First and foremost, Cristie is the most amazing, kindest and helpful person you'll meet. Any time I had any kind of issue, she was always there willing to assist me any way she can. A little back story, I moved from Florida to NY knowing no one. She made it feel like home the second I moved in and met her.  She is so incredibly supportive and amazing at communicating. She also has the most extraordinary energy to be around but she always respects your space and privacy. I consider Cristie as my sister and I've gained such a great friendship that I know will continue beyond my stay. 

In terms of location, this place is the absolute best. Prospect Park is right in front of the building. Prospect Park always has awesome events going on, whether that be during the summer or winter time. There's an iceskating rink very close to the apartment and going to Smorgasburg in the summer months was always a fun time. The Q train is only a minute or so away and getting anywhere is super convenient and easy, whether it be down to Coney Island or into the Upper East Side! There are grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants,  bars, coffee shops and everything you need within a short walking distance as well. Cristie always had the best recommendations! 

The home itself is small (NY is like that), but it's so cozy and has everything you need. The room itself is quite large for NY and it has plenty of storage space to put all your things. The kitchen is equipped with absolutely anything you might need if you wanted to cook. Cristie also has a cat named Gustav, which I've grown so close to! He is the most adorable cat. I actually am allergic to cats, but had little to no issues being around him! I miss him so much already. 

All in all, I can't recommend this place enough. Cristie, thank you so much for everything."

Gya is a fantastic host and was super fast to respond to any and all questions. For anyone who may be concerned about the neighborhood (Crown Heights doesn’t get the best press) DON’T BE. I walked to work for months from this spot, often past the Albany housing projects, and never once did I sense or see malice or danger. In fact, I’ve been living all over Crown Heights for more than a year now and I’ve never had cause for concern. One always has to be smart in any urban environment, for sure, but this area isn’t even ‘shady’."

First of all, Lynne's place is tidy, cozy and beautiful. Our private room and bathroom were perfect for privacy after a day walking the streets of NYC. The appartment is perfectly located in the awesome neighborhood of Williamsburg : you just have a 5 min walk to the L train which leads to midtown in 15 min. The neighborhood is safe with every facilities around, it's also very friendly and have some cool places to hang out.
But what we'll remember the most, in these troubled times, is probably Lynne's kindness. We were 2 French tourist stuck between covid19 outbreak in our country AND in the US. We had to reschedule our flight and get back home early. She was very understanding and tried to help us as she could. We very felt like we had at least one people from family in this foreign country. We will always remember that very bizarre but cool holidays with her and hope to get back there ASAP.

Thank you Lynne for everything, you made that strange vacation one of our kindest memory."

You enter a building at street level with several apartments and it’s one flight up, with two bedrooms with windows off a central living and dining space that is open to a kitchen and has an adjacent bathroom.  The quiet apartment was clean and had all the amenities indicated in the listing.  Mr. W. does not appear to live there but was friendly and clear in communications and responded extremely fast when messaged via Airbnb or telephoned.  He met us at the apartment to provide building keys and a keypad code used to enter the apartment itself.

Unfortunately, the timing of our visit was not good, as we arrived the very day major activities in the city began closing because of COVID-19, so we decided to cut our visit short and stayed only three of the nine nights we had reserved.  But our time there was very pleasant.

The apartment is well located in Brooklyn, on Warren St. close to 4th Ave. and several short blocks from a number of subway lines and easy access to the rest of NYC.  You’ll find 5th Ave. a more useful neighborhood street to check out, with its excellent range of shops, restaurants, etc., and a Key Food Supermarket close by."

Sophie is a very friendly and considerate host, and has made sure that everything you could ever need in an apartment is available (from hygiene products to clean towels) upon your arrival. If there were any questions or queries I had, Sophie would always reply within minutes. The neighborhood is also fantastic, with plenty of restaurants, jazz bars and cafes, and the subway station is only a couple of minutes away. This has truly felt like home and I would give both the apartment and the host my warmest recommendations. Thank you very much Sophie!"

Te deja tu espacio personal y solo pide que seas cuidadoso con el lugar, ya que ambos vivirán ahí y hay que ser limpio, al final es tu casa. El lugar es acogedor, limpio, cercano al metro, seguro para entrar, tiene atracciones muy cercanas, como el Apollo Theater y a unos 20/30 minutos caminando está Central Park, también puedes llegar en metro, que está en la puerta misma del departamento. El sistema de entrada es seguro y tú tienes tu propia llave para tu pieza. También hay lugares para comer, que están a un paso y abren hasta tarde. Alrededor anda bastante policía también, así que es muy seguro en cuanto a calidad de vida. Recomendado al 1000%. Si te hospedas aquí, no te vas a arrepentir. Además Efrain te da tips para la ciudad y es muy amable, también tiene un mesón con información para visitar y que hacer en Nueva York. Volveremos, de eso no hay duda. Gracias Efrain!!"

It is situated in a nice and safe area (just between Manhattan and Brooklyn, about 10 minutes away from a subway station situated on a line leading directly to Manhattan). I was traveling alone and had absolutely no problem, even when I was walking back home after the night had fallen. In addition, there are also a certain number of places to buy food nearby (shops, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.).
As far as I'm concerned, I was welcomed by Alana and Dan who turned ou to be amazing hosts. They were very friendly and attentive with me, offering me to join them for dinner. I must also say that they cook admirably well !! It is really easy to communicate with them for they do care about the well-being and comfort of their host. 
Ultimately, I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb which allowed me to spend a wonderful time in New York City and where I would definitely come back !"

"692","1935109","618547103",2020-03-15,10824462,"Liz","My stay here was sleep deprived, and very stressful, and not worth the money.
The room had a very big problem with a  loud banging/metal contracting noise from an overhead HVAC/air vent, reported to the hosts on my first night and never checked or repaired by them despite repeated requests. It was impossible to get a decent night’s sleep. The noise did stop late at night but started early in the morning, sometimes restarting as early as 4.30am, always by 6am, and recurring every 10-15 minutes throughout the day. 
I fully understood the Airbnb property's profile ad ""Central heating/ cooling is forced air industrial style"", however, this loud banging noise was NOT normal or acceptable. A visit from a plumber could have easily repaired the banging.
The noise became harder and harder to live with as my stay went on. 
If it was fixed I would have given the property 4 stars. 
But the hosts became quite belligerent and eventually called my polite calls for help “lies” & “rude”.
Also I did not dare cook during my stay as the kitchen gas hob wiring is unsafe and probably illegal, and I could not work the oven. 
The overhead air vent pollution was utterly unacceptable in a residential dwelling.
I would strongly NOT recommend this accommodation."

It’s also very close to Times Square/theatre district, Chelsea, meatpacking,  30min from SOHO, and 40min from the East Village if you are a tourist. The space is nicely furnished and pretty spacious for a Manhattan 2BR. I know I carry a lot of stuff and it never felt crowded. It’s an old apt (like most of Manhattan), but Judson was very communicative and quick about any repairs or questions. This apt is about a 6-8min walk from the ACE (to east side, queens, and BK) trains and about it 10min from the 123 (uptown, downtown) so access is pretty good in general. It’s 30min from Trader Joe’s (70th(?) and broadway) and there are plenty of urgent cares and CVS within 20min. Some people may be deterred from a 5th floor walk up, but it is quietest and safest in my option/experience for a more congested area in NYC. We had an overall good experience for our stay. We left amid the COVID-19 outbreak and Judson was very flexible about changing our end date since our jobs were working from home at that point and we wanted to return home to our families. I really only have one caution is that the apartment does have an old radiator heating system so it does make some noise. However, the room with the radiator is the street side anyway, so it doesn’t really make a big difference. Lighter sleepers— take the smaller room. Normal to heavier sleepers— this makes no difference. Overall great experience, thanks Judson!"

They were very understanding of the continuously changing circumstances and accommodated as needed. They made me literally feel at home. Very private. I believe we only encountered one another accidentally when I was leaving. They were very quick to respond when needed.

The only con I would say was the fact that the area was a tad bit sketchy. That could very well just be my own personal opinion. I did not feel comfortable when out in the area, however, it was very quiet at night etc. It was not many people on the streets, but walking in a uniform, I received lots of glares walking to and fro the bus stop. This was my first time visiting actual neighborhoods in NY so I could have been going with an unrealistic expectation. Also, if you’re a light sleeper, the foot steps may bother you, but it wasn’t a huge deal for me. Nonetheless, they were great."

They live with 2 cats and small chihuahua which are very peaceful and friendly. The room that I stayed in was fairly small, but still large enough to some moderate exercise in as well as having plenty of room to move around. The bathroom is very nice and its cleanliness is maintained very well. The kitchen is a bit small as well, but after a while you get used to the size. It can be a bit noisy in the mornings sometimes, but if you are an early riser like myself, it's absolutely no problem at all! The room stayed nice and warm all winter and I didn't need to bundle up indoors at all, and I'm someone who feels cold easily.

I was a little taken back by how loud it was, BUT Monica is the sweetesttttt person ever.. and the place is better in real life than the pictures. I gave 5 star because Monica was such a lovely person to communicate with and the place was drop dead gorgeous, but personally probably wouldn’t stay again because of how little sound barrier there is between the upstairs apartment.

Edgar is an exceptional host and very quick to respond to queries. Unfortunately I had to end my stay halfway through due to the Coronavirus pandemic and the need to return home - Edgar handled the situation with great understanding . I‘ll definitely be contacting him when I go back to NY after the virus has passed."

Lydia was very helpful and went out of her way to give us our space since this was a bedroom rental in a shared apartment. If you don’t like the idea of getting a bedroom in a place where the host stays, don’t worry about this place. My daughter and I only saw Lydia when we arrived. She was very sweet and accommodating. The bedroom was on the small side, but what I expected for the price and location. It was very clean and cute. One drawback about the room was it was on the chilly side, even with the extra blanket. It wasn’t bad, but if you are going in the winter dress in comfy flannels. The bathroom shower had excellent water pressure. There are a lot of steps going up to Lydia’s apartment. If you get winded easily, or are elderly, this may be a difficult trek for you. In regards to the location...you can easily walk to the Central Park, Times Square, and catch the subway. We would definitely book this again!"

Carrie-Anne made us feel at home and at ease from the get go. After long days of exploring the city it was lovely knowing that we had a super chilled, happy space to rest our achy legs!

The bedroom is clean and sufficient for 2 persons, and the bathroom for ourselves is clean and big enough. There’s really warm when you open the heater. The location of the apartment is great, it takes only 30 seconds from the entrance of 103 St. station. There are lots of restaurants and markets nearby. The supermarket is just next to the building and you can find a 7-11 across the street. It takes about 10-15 minutes to get to Central Park by foot, and 20-25 minutes to downtown. The street is a little bit dark at night, and sometimes you can hear others from the aisle outside.
In spite of these, we still love this place. Because of the issue of Coronavirus, there’s no restaurants, coffee shops, Museums, etc. open while we were here, except supermarket and restaurants which can be take out or delivery.

Both hosts were very nice and communicative if needed, especially with everything going on during this COVID crisis. Check-in was easy. The space is way bigger than the pictures show. Very clean and can be cozy for families or convenient for business. Aesthetically pleasing and location was perfect. In the heart of bushwick and accessible to everything.

From the photos, the place looks very clean and elegant, however, in person the house looks extremely run down and has not been well maintained at all. Supposedly the house had received “deep cleaning” prior to my arrival but I’m not sure who they paid to clean that place since it had cobb webs, dust, and stains on the comforter and towels they provided. In addition, the door doesn’t lock unless you slam it, and they don’t change the code for the door between tenants, which is a major safety issue. Neither my boyfriend or I remember seeing writing in red lipstick on the refrigerator, but the owners insisted it was there prior to my arrival so if it was deep cleaned I’m not sure why it would be left there. The writing said “Houston English scumbag.” I left for work and had checked the lock prior to leaving, but when I came back after work the door literally pushed open as soon as I pushed the first number of the code. They did try to remedy that by changing the code, but by then I had such a horrible experience that I got a hotel. Of note, they have a lock box over the thermostat so it was extremely cold inside the house since it was in the 40s outside (it’s a very old house so poor insulation). They did provide a window unit, however there wasn’t an option for heat on it and eventually we gave up because an air conditioner is worthless in the cold. There is supposedly WiFi, but there wasn’t a password to access it making it completely worthless. For someone that’s in nurse practitioner school, it was imperative that I had access to the internet. I originally came here to help out with the pandemic and I’m fortunate that air bnb was able to refund my money. After working all day in a makeshift hospital and being stressed out all day, this is definitely not the place I would want to come to. Also, if you do stay here be prepared for their nosy neighbor to stand at the end of their driveway and just stare at you like a weirdo every time you pull up. The only positive about this place is that it has a good location, but with the other options available on Staten Island, I would definitely recommend you go elsewhere."

Jake was a great host, welcoming and friendly but private and allowing guests to have their own space. The room was lovely, with the Ella Fitzgerald theme being a nice touch. It's a little small, if anything, and the futon might not suit those of you who are taller, but they're small complaints.

Loved my little bedroom; wish the weather would have cooperated more, so I could have used the balcony. Nice touch! The bathroom was very clean; it was nice having one to myself, so I could spread my stuff out during my stay.

Having the split level loft was awesome, too. I truly felt like I had the apartment to myself during my stay. I also felt like me getting up super early every morning wouldn't bother Lisa.

Ginger was a welcome bonus! Ginger is the lovely housecat that'll greet you as you open the apartment's front door. She is super sweet!"

Scott and Samantha are always available and respond quickly to questions. Really can’t say enough about how helpful they were in a time where we all feel a little helpless being away from home. Would 100% use again!

The house has everything that's needed, space enough for 2 people. Bedroom can be a little dry (bc of radiator) for sensitive people.

It is very spacious and appears exactly like the picture and the descriptions. 
Very close to F train, which is only a stop away from lower east manhattan. 
Very short walk to DUMBO - i loved walking at nights. 

I left early and cancelled my reservation because I spotted two cockroaches and two spiders during my stay. I have been to NYC multiple times (countless, actually) and never saw any cockroaches. They were not in a cornered area, but they were on the kitchen table and in the sink. I could not stay any longer, so I asked airbnb to give me a partial refund for the stay and got out of there that night. 
Also, the bathroom had mold growing on the shower curtains and I had to wash it away before I took a shower."

The place is located in a wonderful safe clean Lennox Hill area with subway nearby as well as everything else you might need such as grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. The apartment itself was even better than in the photos. Super clean, stocked with all essentials and is very modern yet (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy mattress and plenty of sunshine in my room. Clean bathroom and kitchen areas. And overall, Evgenia thought of every little detail to make your stay as comfortable as possible. From plants to a glass of water on my nightstand, it was so lovely.

He texted me, asked whether I am ok, came to exchange from a safe distance and both he and his wife were very kind. As they live in the apartment next to the airbnb, they are always available to react immediately on any questions or anything you need. I was feeling really cold the first night and they immediately got me few extra blankets and an extra heater so I was definitely well equipped for an Antarctic winter. Great people!
Location of the flat is excellent, next to the metro and super central in Harlem on walking distance from shops, cool restaurants and bars, also the Apollo Theater  is a 5 min walk. Ask  Laurent, they have a book with all recommended places! 
The studio itself is very good as well, perfect if you need a place to stay for sight-seeing or as I was there -to work. I even spent almost a week working from home from there due to COVID which was of course a bit tricky, but it still worked. It has a microwave, a kitchen, a coffee machine, 4 stoves and a little baking oven so you could even have a meal there ( a luxury for NY flats). It is small so I would say a couple plus a small child should be fine there.
Overall, great and thanks so much!"

The apartment itself is clean and modernly decorated. Comfortable, quaint and has everything you need for an extended stay in Manhattan. The only “downside” is that there is no oven, just a microwave. Apparently it works as an oven as well but I couldn’t figure it out. Also it faces Broadway so if you are a light sleeper, it may be bothersome but I slept great :) 
Ofer was also a pleasure to deal with and replied to all my queries quickly. Thank you again for a great stay!"

"1010","3835681","620158066",2020-03-21,337885147,"Anthony","SAFETY WARNING—AVOID AVOID AVOID!! If you read many of his other reviews (at least 8 of them) those who stay more then one day he always causes them problems. Rude, impolite, selfish are all very accurate ways to describe him as mentioned by other guests. NOT WORTH ANY SAVINGS TO STAY WITH HIM AS HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT OTHERS and is a LIAR! UNSAFE!!

He is DISHONEST. He mentions his mom is VISITING him. Yet, reviews over the past 4 years tell otherwise. His MOM actually LIVES with him secretly in the LIVING room, and she doesn’t speak English. Imagine the confusion when she stays home all day and tries to talk with you every time you go to the kitchen or leave the house. She will use the bathroom and kitchen all day and you will
NOT have access to the amenities that you paid for.

He ALSO rents out his room WITHOUT his landlords permission, hence he tries to have you go to the side of the apartment, late at night which is very unsafe.  He will also LAUGH at you if you struggle finding his hidden secret entrance for Airbnb guests late at night! HORRIBLE RUDE PERSON! DISHONEST.

2. I had a friend come over to grab something and said she would be gone within a few minutes. We were SUPER quiet and the only way he would have known is if he stayed in his room, watching his crazy security cameras. Without seconds, HE FREAKED out and THREATENED to call the POLICE saying I “broke his rules”! . After checking his “RULES” again he has more rules than most FATHERS do for their 8 year old DAUGHTER. HE THREATENED TO ALSO PUSH ME OUT OF THE HOUSE if I did NOT leave!! AGGRESSIVE AND HOSTILE!! He stood in my room for nearly 2 HOURS after she left trying to reach Airbnb at 830pm. Eventually I felt uncomfortable and left around 10pm. I reported to Airbnb and he should be off this website due to multiple unnecessary threats.   Again, AVOID him, he is NOT a people person or good with people at all.

THANKFULLY, last minute alternative hotels were cheap due to COVID-19 and  I left that night. I was promised by Airbnb support already a refund of the last 2 nights + his strange cleaning fee thankfully. THIS GUY IS STRANGE AND ENJOYS TRYING TO MAKING OTHETS LIVES MISERABLE. He should NOT be allowed to host and 4.2 reviews for a host are VERY LOW compared to competitors. HE ENJOYS FEELING POWERFUL AND ABUSING HIS RIGHTS AS A HOST. VERY STRANGE GUY. Honestly believe he gets jealous of others easily and lacks confidence in himself. He clearly lives a very stressful NYC life trying to make ends meet.

3. OLD OLD HOUSE, cold shower,  HARD bed, SLOW wifi. 

DO NOT STAY WITH HIM- BOOK ANYWHERE ELSE.  I AM GLAD I HELPED SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY AND STRESS. It’s UNSAFE and he does NOT care about YOU or anyone else besides MONEY!"

Aurelie is an amazing host. Very kind and responsive. The space was clean and comfortable with nice amenities. The bathroom looked freshly remodeled by someone with a good idea for design. Very well done.

If you stay, familiarize yourself with the pictures and (Hidden by Airbnb) Street view before you arrive to check in. We were a little confused as to which house it was at first die to lack of street numbers. Once we pulled up the photos to compare it was easily identifiable. Check in and out was a breeze.

Five minute walk from major bus stops and the train station. Short ride to the ferry.

Highly recommend. We stayed right at the beginning of the covid 19 panic and would've stressed much more without Aurelie's advice and tips. She helped us turn a scary situation into an enjoyable one."

His place is right in the heart of Brooklyn, a short walk from great bagel places and park slope. Muse cafe (right downstairs) is one of my favorite places for breakfast and coffee, and all of the promenades right outside are in beautiful, brownstone neighborhoods. He's a four-minute walk away from the F and G, which will take you into Manhattan in ~20 minutes. Dave himself is a fantastic host. He keeps the place really clean, respects your privacy, and is very quiet. He's also a bit of a Renaissance man, being a music producer, developer, and avid reader!  I had a great time, and I will be staying at his place when I'm back in NYC for a visit."

The apartment is so cozy we completely felt home, it is quiet (unusual for NY),stylish and spotless. The kitchen is a classical Brownstone kitchen from the 20th century and incredibly spacious, perfect for nice diners in family. You can tell everything has been thought as you won't need anything else to cook etc, same for the bathroom that is  immaculate white.
The neighborhood is very convenient, with plenty of cute restaurants around, and supermarkets and easy access Downtown. 
 We loved playing in the garden and our daughter was so delighted to jump and play with their adorable daughters in the trampoline.
Nicki and David are a beautiful artist couple, so caring and friendly that we left this place with wonderful memories!

The location is perfect, it’s in the heart of Brooklyn and only a 5 minute walk to the subway (J line). 
There are many places to eat nearby (delis, small restaurant, bars etc.)

The guesthouse itself is very spacious, it was just the two of us staying there but it’s big enough for a whole family. 
An extremely cozy place, felt like home instantly, especially the comfy couch - with Netflix it was hard for us to leave it lol   
The kitchen had all amenities one needs 

Everything was perfectly clean, you could basically eat off the floor. 
We appreciated that Jenny put an extra effort to disinfect the entire place because of the current virus situation. 

That brings me to my favorite part - which was Jenny herself. Such a warm person and so helpful, with everything she could. 
She responded quick and at all times. Since our check out was early and our flight not until the evening, she let us stow our bags at hers. 

I loved this little gem and will definitely come back to hers when I visit NYC again!"

The cons: This feels more like you're crashing at a friend's apartment than staying at an Airbnb. The place is fairly clean, but not much has been done to prepare it for receiving guests. The host's personal items, including shoes, jackets, etc, are taking up a lot of the space; the desk is covered with personal items; dirty laundry was left in the bathroom; etc. Other things you might expect an Airbnb host to think of are absent. Examples: no reading light near the bed (or any lighting at all in half the apartment); fridge was full of host's food with little extra space (I can understand this if a guest is coming for 1-2 nights, but I booked the place for 8 days); a bit of closet space was left but the closet door was blocked by host's shoes and there were no available hangers in the closet (I don't think most people travel with hangers). There was also a lot of large, expensive recording equipment in the apartment (check-in instructions warn guests not to touch it), which I was a bit afraid of damaging. Some hosts approach Airbnb in this more casual, couch-surfing kind of way (and again, there weren't any major cleanliness issues and Timothy is friendly), but it's definitely something to be aware of before you book this one."

Doors are keyless entries, which is nice to not have to carry around a key all day (and worry about losing it). Front door can feel stuck so you may have to really heave against it. 
Host is very poor at communication. Two months (when I booked) and then two weeks before our stay I inquired about the use of the Pack n Play for our infant and didn't hear back until the day we checked in. 
Cleanliness was a bit of an issue: rugs are in need of a good vacuum, we caught lots of clumps of hair and dust; shelves were also quite dusty.

We were a party of 10 and had enough space and privacy for each person. The many bathrooms were one of the main reasons why we chose to reserve this Airbnb over others we were looking at. The location was also in close proximity to EVERYTHING! We were able to walk to restaurants, shops, and the subway. The Harlem Jazz House is absolutely beautiful, honestly. The only complaint we had was that it was very cold downstairs (first floor & below). The space heaters did but so much to heat the lower levels. Joyce did send an HVAC technician out but this was on the morning of our check-out. Other than the heating situation, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this space."

Less than 5-minute walk to subway. It is a 10-minute walk to the Keycafe, but it wasn't too bad. It may be more difficult with larger luggage. Although it was cold outside, the apartment stayed nice and warm. Apartment was nice and clean, although the building hallways smelled like cigarette smoke. Hallway odors cannot be smelled from inside the apartment itself. Sounds from the Manhattan Bridge are easily heard (although not too bothersome) while watching TV in the living room, but are barely heard in the bedroom. Did not notice the those sounds while trying to sleep. Bedroom was cozy. Bathroom was modern and clean. It was nice having both a fixed and handheld shower head. Kitchen was small but typical of NYC and had everything we needed. It was nice having a TV with a Roku stick in the living room so I could relax and watch shows/Youtube after a long day. Host responded very quickly to messages and was very accommodating with our late check out request since we had an evening flight. Perfect place to rest after a busy day in NYC. Would stay here again because of the convenient location to subway and restaurants."

I will agree with others that the heat was a bit much even once you opened a window.  Also if you are traveling with two or more people, or plan to stay longer than a week ( I was there for 4 weeks) you need to be aware that there is only one set of bedding provided and two towels.  I did contact the host to request more bedding however that was a dead end so I went out and got my own for the remainder of my stay.   

There is also no microwave at this location so please keep that in mind. Now as far as the wifi goes it was PERFECT.  I used this location to work from home and the wifi service allowed me to perform my work task with out any issues, and I am extremely grateful for that. 

So that is my run down of my stay... For the price some might be willing to sleep on the same sheets for four weeks I would rather not."

I asked Nick to host a dinner party for my sister (9 people all family or close friends) Nick agreed. The only reason there was more than 9 people at one point, was to help me set up the bnb for the occasion. 
I was last to arrive, as I was cooking. All of the guests were Black or Latinx. Admittedly we were reckless transferring between our cars and the bnb as we did not wear masks. Luckily, we all live together in one way or another. Also, we were able to find parking directly in front of the building. As soon as my sister arrived, a neighbor came down and asked ""Who are you?"" She was the birthday girl,  this event was a surprise. She told the neighbor that I had booked that bnb. Was there a problem? He said he noticed no one was wearing masks. Reader, when the neighbor approached strangers to inquire who they were, he was not wearing a mask. My sister pointed out as much and reminded him they all came from the same place and to follow social distancing rules. He said he would ""check inside to make sure everything was ok."" 
This interaction, from the start made my sister and her friends uncomfortable. When I arrived, I too, noticed the unwarranted stares from neighbors without masks. Because we are P.O.C. in this mostly white neighborhood and were already being antagonized we kept the music low and when it got late, turned off the music altogether. Most guests left after eating, leaving 5 of us remaining. 
We were using the backyard to smoke, we were told by the neighbor who approached us about the masks the yard was not part of the bnb. So we came back upstairs. No music on, 5 of proceeded to converse quietly among ourselves as this is now the second time we've been chastised. Reader, I live in an apartment complex similar to the one we rented. My neighbors make all types of noise at all hours of the day, this is to be expected. We live in a compact city. 5 people in a large apartment, 2 having an intimate conversation and the other 3 casually conversing with music off should not be much of a disturbance no matter the time. Especially considering this was a week of civil unrest in our country. Everyone is home because of the pandemic, my friends and I had been going out to protest almost daily, we're not ready to go to sleep at 1 A.M. 
Again, the same neighbor came downstairs and told us to keep it down. I pointed around and said there are only 5 people have quiet conversations, he said the window was open. Someone closed the window, he insisted we cut it out anyway. 
Reader, I paid more than 300 to host my sister a dinner party where she could rest her head after her birthday. We all ended up getting in our cars and leaving. I realized that in the absence of police presence, white people try to become an enforcer of authority. It was extremely uncomfortable for us and I have never experienced anything like this. 
Again,. we were cavalier about arriving in masks, even though the cars were right across the street, we should have worn them. But we were not excessively noisy. We were in fact, quiet somber. The apartment is as described, so you will definitely enjoy that."

There are lots of great restaurants nearby and Charlene is very helpful with any questions, plus she has great tips on places to go and to eat. She often sat with us at the table and chatted after we got back at night, and was always friendly and fun to talk to. The only drawback for us was that it was a little noisy at night, someone in the apartment above us often paced around until midnight or 1am and sometimes made it hard to sleep. I doubt you're going to find a quiet place in NYC at any time of day or night though, so we still rate this place a head and shoulders above our last stay in NY.

I always choose where I am going to stay on the recommendations of others and that is why I elected to book Ivan's....it was much better than expected and quite cosy, Ivan met me personally and explained everything and always responded quickly.  You can tell it is Ivan's personal apartment which I liked, it was stocked with everything one would need as if
you lived there yourself. He was quick with recommendations for restaurants and local
interests, unfortunately I was in New York during the coronavirus and that dampened the
atmosphere of the city as one might expect. But Ivan allowed me to stay another day and
I would not hesitate to book Ivan's place again when I return to New York."

The place is slightly off the beaten path (which is how we prefer our travel adventures) but a 5 minute walk to a subway stop brings you to a straight shot to anywhere you want to go in the city. Night walks were no concern either - the path was well lit and the porch and foyer were nice and bright. The place is cozy and surprisingly quiet! I have food allergies so we did some cooking out of convenience. Everything was there for us to cook meals and a small but well stocked grocery store by the subway stop made it even better. Kumar had great recommendations for food and places to visit. Our trip was sadly cut short due to the ongoing pandemic but we plan on coming back in the fall and won’t consider staying anywhere else except here. Thank you, Kumar, for your kindness and being such a gracious host. I hope we are able to meet next time around!!"

A few things to note, The street parking is only allowed for a few odd hours here and there, rendering it pretty much useless. The apartment is at the top of two sets of narrow vintage stairs, which are cute, but not great for anyone who has any trouble with stairs whatsoever. The laundry on-site is a shared coin laundry in the basement of the building.
The apartment is very spacious and anytime we needed anything we could contact the host directly and were responded to very kindly and promptly. The location is nice with several corner stores in a very short walking distance. For the price, this was a good spot."

It`s  a great, clean place with a great location. 100% recommendation! A few minutes to walk and you are at the water, where you can enjoy the view over to Manhatten-Skyline (or you simply use rooftop or the balcony). The connection to Lexington (Central Manhatten) was fantastic, a short walk and you can pick a train to the center. Also the interior decoration was very nice, clean and the bed comfortable. We felt very happy here. Vadim is a great, attentive host.

Es ist einfach ein toller, sauber Platz mit grandioser Lage. Eine 100 % ige Weiterempfehlung. Wenige Minuten zu Fuß, dann ist man am Fluss und genießt den Blick über das Wasser auf Manhatten. Auch die Anbindung zur Lexington war fantastisch, ein kurzer Spaziergang und dann war man schon an einer Art S-Bahn, die direkt ins Center fährt. Auch die Inneneinrichtung war sehr schön, sauber und das Bett bequem. Wir haben uns hier wohl gefühlt. Vadim ist ein toller, aufmerksamer Gastgeber."

It was definitely a weird time to be in someone else’s home (which I would try to avoid if there is another national disaster in the future). That said, I decided to wait it out and see if things will start to change in a few weeks since I just moved across the country. Sarah is friendly and knowledgeable about the neighborhood. And since she normally works from home, she's there if you have any questions!

A few things to note, the unit is maintained but the building not so much considering it was built so long ago. The room is cozy and cute but very small. It is also located on the 3rd floor of a walk-up so pack accordingly. 

Otherwise, the listing looks like the pictures (other than minor differences). Location is key since it's close to the city and the subway stop is less than 2 minutes away. It's located in an up and coming neighborhood with a laundromat a block away and various stores, restaurants, and bars to keep you entertained (unless everything is closed due to a quarantine). "

When I needed things changed in the room, Jessica went above and beyond to make sure I got those changes as soon as possible and also made sure that I was very comfortable. This was definitely my top airbnb experience thus far. My individual room is pretty spacious with a brand new full size memory foam bed, big closet, a very large desk, and a ton of shelf space. The room infrastructure is more on the older side (as most NYC apartments are like this)  but Jessica added new interiors to it such as a brand new bed and shelving which greatly brought balance. There is no central heating in my room but Jessica provided a heater which was enough to warm up the room for me. There is a lot of natural lighting as there is a big window in the room. This place was very ideal for my long term stay (months). In the whole apartment, everything was very clean and supplies were always present. One of my biggest worries about airbnbs are that they are not as clean as hosts claim them to be. Jessica was very true to her word with cleanliness. The bathrooms and kitchen were always spotless. I never had to wait to use the 2 bathrooms even when there were 3 other long term individuals living in the apartment. My three other roommates were very friendly and that was very unexpected bc most New Yorkers mind their own business and don't converse unless they have to haha. It was great living with them as they were all very nice and warm people. I didn't feel uncomfortable around them at all. There is a washer and dryer in the apartment and that was so convenient to have. Her location is also very ideal as it is in the heart of Queens and located within 5 minutes of the multiple train stations and lines. It is also relatively quiet. Roommates are very respectful when it comes to cleanliness and noise and they expect the same from you as well. There are house rules which I appreciated since it kept the apartment clean and orderly. All in all, I really loved Jessica's place. Her place is truly a gem. If I need to return to Elmhurst for work-related business, I will definitely be considering her location again."

"1209","5010368","623925904",2020-05-04,235758525,"Angeleaza","We had two major issues during our time at Daniel’s place:

1) My husband and I had planned to live in this Airbnb for six weeks as we tried to wait out the COVID pandemic and find a permanent apartment in NYC (we had just moved for a job when the quarantine began). The host had not left a mail key, which was an issue since we were in quarantine and working from home. We let him know immediately, and he was responsive, saying that he would contact the super for a spare key. We still didn’t have a key more than a week later, so he told us to go ahead and call a locksmith to change the lock and he would reimburse us. We did, and then he said the price was too high (which was a standard locksmith price) and he would only give us $40. We have since escalated the issue to Airbnb for review.

2) We had been noticing weird bits of trash and hearing scratching noises since we arrived, but didn’t think much of it. Then we saw a rat run through the space into the bedroom. We then realized that the “crumbs” we had been sweeping up all over the apartment were actually rat droppings, and we found an opening in the back of the bedroom radiator. Luckily, we discovered this shortly into our trip, and we were able to move to another space. We are very clean people and had been consistently taking out the trash and recycling and not leaving food out (especially since there was not a trash can in the kitchen/living area).

Also, please bear in mind that this place is not conducive to long term visits. The space is over cluttered and there is not much storage, as the host has items in both closets. The sliding glass door is to the balcony is the best feature, but the door does not lock; there are just metal obstacles that you place in the track to jam the door. The metal handle of the door was cracked when we arrived and actually broke and badly scratched my hand a few days in.

That being said, check-in was easy, Daniel was fairly responsive prior to the rat incident, and Daniel had been kind in allowing us to arrive two weeks later than anticipated due to illness. But all in all, this was a horrible and semi-traumatizing Airbnb experience. We have stayed at several others and truly have never had a complaint. We’re easily contented, but this was intolerable."

Instructions on the air conditioner said to only press On/Off as the one in the bedroom had the tendency to drip. It dripped anyway. On the bed. The rear terrace was nice to have, as were the complimentary bicycles - saved some money on Citybikes! As a lived-in space, I liked that there were common amenities that for-rent-only  AirBnBs often lack; mainly a colander, multiple choices of cooking pans, and scissors. That was nice."

The host was very responsive to our requests to remove the AC units from the windows to keep out noise and cold, and fix windows that were stuck.  Check-in was easy.
Cons: The apartment is drab and could use some TLC (a paint job, re-plaster the cracked and falling ceiling, clean the stove's exhaust hood/fan, reglaze or replace the kitchen sink) and more décor on the walls.  There are basic amenities, but not those we've become accustomed to in other Airbnb units we've stayed in for a month (e.g., very few cleaning supplies, no cooking staples such as salt, pepper, cooking oil, etc.).  The bedroom is very dark, with a window that looks out on an airshaft, never any sunlight. There is a very noisy neighbor upstairs, who sounds like an elephant stomping around the apartment, and frequently comes home after 1 a.m."

Just a note that may be useful to some: 
1) Please note that the place is a 5th story walk-up. (Edythe says this in her listing.) This is par for the course for New York, but may be important to consider if accessibility is a concern, or you have very heavy luggage. 

2) The shower is in the main living space. This is not a problem, and is generally harmless. BUT could be a consideration if traveling with someone who isn't a romantic partner (like a parent or sibling). 

Otherwise, enjoy!"

호스트 닉은 늘 친절하고 따뜻하게 맞이해주었습니다! 여행 오기전에는 위치가 센트럴에서 조금 멀다고 느껴졌지만 막상 도착하니 조용하고 활기찬 동네에 지하철역도 가까워서 몹시 만족했습니다. 닉의 취미가 청소가 아닌가 싶을만큼 매일 아침저녁으로 청소기가 돌아가는 소리를 듣게 되실거에요:)
이 위치에 이 가격에 이 청결도 찾기 힘들었습니다. 저는 10일간 닉의 집에 머물렀는데 난방과 청결 위치 모든것에 만족하는 즐거운 여행이 되었습니다. 인테리어 구경하는 재미와 푹신한 매트리스 청결한 집에 좋은 대접을 받고 가는것 같아 행복합니다!
집처럼 편안하게 지낼수 있으며 합리적인 가격의 뉴욕 숙소를 찾고 계신다면 닉의 집을 추천합니다"

He is a kind, creative, and generous person who's positive energy permeates throughout the place. The apartment is a character within itself. Very spacious, which is refreshing and rare in NYC. It is decorated with his personal artwork and trinkets that give the place a beautiful personality of its own.  Lucas makes sure that you're set and that you feel at home. Everything was perfectly laid out for me. Instructions and who to contact in the event that he was unavailable. It was just a wonderful experience and I cannot recommend his place enough.  I would stay there again and I hope to do so. Thank you, Lucas. And stay safe out there in NYC. I will see you again."

Wir konnten somit nicht in die Wohnung hinein. Leider hat die Gastgeberin ihr Telefon verloren, sodass wir erst 3 Stunden später eine Antwort erhalten haben. Da es mittlerweile Abends war, haben wir uns ein Hotelzimmer gebucht. 
Am nächsten Tag konnten wir aber ganz normal einchecken. Das Zimmer ist größer, als die Bilder es vermuten lassen und sehr gemütlich und sauber. Die Ausstattung ist ebenfalls einwandfrei. Die Lage ist super. Innerhalb von 5-10 Minuten ist man an der 125 Station. Von hieraus fährt minütlich eine Metro. 
Wir haben den Aufenthalt trotz anfänglicher Schwierigkeiten genossen."

Smoke sensitive people might not find ideal conditions as building residents smoke outside the first floor, street facing apt. But, under non-pandemic conditions, you probably wouldn’t spend much time indoors.

Kenneth is great to deal with as he is professional, flexible, considerate and responsive. Just the right balance of qualities.

If you’re looking for a real NYC experience, at a reasonable rate, this is it!"
"1293","5691347","621595465",2020-04-02,644904,"Donna","We chose Nancy's place over much lower priced hotel rooms (i.e. Hilton and Marriott were far less expensive) because a kitchen was needed during this global pandemic.  Then a rest in place order came that was stricter, and having a kitchen was even more important.  If a toaster oven (if you make sure the fuse is set properly) and hot plate = a full kitchen and is fine for you, then it will work.  The posting is misleading.  She is clear that it is an air mattress.  She will also rent to you for less than the 30 days stipulated in NY, so that was helpful - we had another place rented via AirBnB starting on the day the reservation was over (April 2nd)  once we saw it was not livable ongoing under the circumstances. Ended up going out of town altogether to a safer place. We requested a refund for the nights we were not there (about half of the time we had reserved) but she did not seem to understand that we chose the apartment over a hotel because of a kitchen, or that the other place we had reserved was AFTER the reservation with her - so refused any refund at all because she said we made it with the intent to get our money back.   Absolutely not the case.  Overall, the place is probably fine if you are ok with an air mattress and will be eating out most all of the time."

The apartment is made up in an old-time eclectic style. I experienced it as cozy, especially as it's all the way on the top floor - it had a nice ""get away"" feel. It was a very quiet and peaceful stay, just as I like it, and there was a very generous collection of cooking utensils and sundries. Hosts are super nice people!"

The children’s toys and books kept my daughter entertained when we were in the apartment and the apartment itself kept myself and my husband entertained. The apartment (to us) felt like a true New York style apartment, what we imagined it to be anyway. High ceilings, wooden flooring and a fire escape outside the kitchen window. The layout was perfect in relation to having our wee girl nearby but also in her own room. Sam was a great host, loads of communication and the apartment manual was really helpful. Williamsburg area is really cool and we found lots of vegan places to eat. We even found an all vegan American style diner for breakfast called Champs. Unfortunately our stay was cut short due to the covid-19 outbreak, however that just means we need to return again soon to see New York in its proper glory!"

There are tons of restaurants near by and the park is just a 30 minute walk. But, above this, Ayal is a super host who went out of his way to be accommodating during the corona virus outbreak.

Greg was away during my trip so I had the apartment to myself but he was very fast in replying to any questions I had.

But it is worth noting that the described location is quite different from reality: the place is in a Hasidic neighborhood several blocks south of where it is listed.

Could use some updating. Bathroom was nice. The common space was great with the kitchen area. The host allowed us to lock and leave our suitcases after check-out which was a plus.

The location itself is amazing, and I'd imagine it's a really great area when everything's open. As it was, everything other than the local deli and supermarket were closed and so we basically never left the apartment - but I can't think of a place I'd rather have been ""stuck at home"" in. The apartment is cozy, really comfortable and quiet and Michael's got a great sense of style. The TV (set up with Netflix and Prime) and speakers (if you've got a newer iPhone don't forget your adapter) were a welcome addition, and the Kitchen had everything we needed to cook for ourselves every day. All in all, I loved the apartment and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the East Village."

There’s a subway line at one end of the block & a citibike station at the other. 
It’s a 15 minute walk to Central Park.
Loads of coffee shops, bars & restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
Sadly we can’t vouch for any of them as we visited during the COVID-19 outbreak  

No complaints about the apartment - great space that was big enough for the 2 of us. The bathroom is tiny but then it’s a bathroom! Does exactly what you’d expect of a bathroom.  Shower is still awesome & there was always hot water. 
Comfy beds in 2 double-sized bedrooms & storage space for clothes, a fab living space with a couch & tv & full kitchen. 
The table & chairs were a nice addition - somewhere to eat a meal should you choose to eat in. 
Be was a great host & always responded quickly to messages. 
I would definitely stay here again."

When I woke up and went to my car it was totaled on the sidewalk all I could do was cry  I explained the situation to Michael told him how I had to wait for my police report and that I needed an extra day he said I had pay ... Now when I got there the room was filthy the whole building stunk i always bring my own things and with the virus being so crazy I definitely was prepared had mattress cover some baking soda pinesol, Lysol , some candles and some unstoppable fabric spray it’s a shame I had to use it all he didn’t provide me with any linen but I also had my own sheets and blanket ..

So don't expect a brand new looking place or updated looking place.There is a full kitchen that you can use. The bedroom is a decent size with enough room for 2 to be comfortable. The bed is comfortable too.  The building wasn't too noisy and the outside wasn't too busy. But some who aren't familiar with Brooklyn or the area may be intimidated by the location. I was never uneasy at anytime of my stay. Id stay here again and will be telling friends about this hidden gem. It just needs a little TLC. But where can you book a room for an overnight stay for under$60 in NYC? Nowhere!!! Its a bargain and I feel like I got what I paid for. Plus side: I saw no roaches or mice and Wi-Fi was great, a strong connection. And I wasn't harassed to leave in the morning."

We were able to hang out together in a stylish space, have coffee / tea in the morning, store food in the fridge, work (good wifi), take hot showers etc. The mattresses were comfy enough and there was plenty of room for all our luggage. Great and quick communication and check in. It's not the nicest street but it felt safe and good food + views of Manhattan / the bridges are about a 15-20min walk. Would recommend staying here!"

However, there were a few issues with the apartment. On the first night, I found a used band-aid in the bedsheets in the bedroom, which was pretty gross. Also, when I went to use the washer/dryer a few days into my stay, I noticed a pool of water in the unit. The kitchen doesn’t have a microwave but otherwise fine.  no way to control the temperature.

Great price for the location but maybe not ideal for a long stay."

When she left I took pictures of everything only because she had two bad reviews and happy I did. There was hair in the bathing in the shower, mouse poop on the kitchen draws and I saw a roaches on the floor and walls upstairs, all which I took a pics. Her house rules where no party, not smoking, no loud noise, no drugs, no pets all which I followed.  Me and my brother stayed there and invited my cousin over to talk and catch up, my cousin was only coming over not spending the night AT ALL. My host claims no socializing was a house rule . You can’t have people come over at all. But it was not and I took screenshots of here house rules. My host claims we threw a party in her house because we where so call to loud and texted me which I have screenshots of here discriminating against black peoples mutiple times!!!She said she doesn’t like renting to people like me (younge and black) and will never again and said this to me threw text 3 times. She doesn’t like people like me. There is one tv which is right next to the basement where the host mother stays. I do admit I sleep with the tv on ( I need noise to sleep) but other then that the mother of the owner who stay downstairs over exaggerated the noise. U can see on camera me walking my cousin out the house so she did not spend the night. The house was beautiful but the harassing and texting claiming we was having a party was too much And the discrimination. She threaten to call the police on me which I wish she did so she could see there was only 3 people in the house at at the time. I did not stay for my 2 night I left the next day at 1:30pm. And reported her. If your black and young DOO NOT BOOK HER. She is racist. She didn’t want me there to beginning with Not only did I leave early she didn’t want to give me a partial refund and wanted to over charge $300 which is NO WHERE IN her Fees listing, cleaning fee is 55$ extra ppl is 40$ and security deposit is 200$. JUST DONT BOOK HER SHE DOESNT LIKE BLACK YOUNGE PEOPLE and will text you paragraphs complaining if you laugh to loud. Worst experience ever. All cause I’m young and black."

The bathroom and kitchen was constantly cleaned by ikkyu, and having all the tools in the kitchen was very helpful as well.

Paul leaves no stone untouched - whether it’s the lovely lamps that provide the perfect ambience, the full kitchen with an oven, dishwasher and microwave, the designer magazine bed and pillows, the pictures of New York scattered throughout the apartment, or the lush bathroom soaps and body wash.   

Staying in the apartment is better than any New York hotel experience.   It’s 10 stars for cleanliness and it’s in the heart of the amazing Greenwich Village.   Two stone throws away from all that dynamic New York has to offer. 

Paul is the New York brother I never knew I had.   Always so quick on the messages and always so accommodating.   He allowed me to come and go around my flight times. 

My only complaint is that I did not find this apartment sooner!

Paul thanks for being such an amazing host.   I will be back and I look forward to hosting you when you come to visit :)

John has been a really great host and has made me feel like a visiting family member. He is very strict with his house rules (which are more than reasonable) and that is a good thing. He will go the extra mile to make your stay more pleasant. Hope we can share more time in the future!
Disclaimer: I could only stay with John the first month of the three I had planned due to the COVID19 pandemic. In this regard, while John has always been a 10 in handling the situation, AirBnB has been super rude and unhelpful, an absolute 0 for AirBnB. John will not let you down, but AirBnB will leave you stranded without blinking. Keep that in mind!"

Right by the subway and near great neighborhoods.  The place was a bit dirty overall- disappointing.  There was no overhead light in the bathroom- just a small desk lamp on a shelf.  only one lightbulb in each light so the entire apartment was dark.  No soap- really?  But there were 5 bottles of used shampoo...  None in the bathroom or kitchen.  Bed was just ok.   A good cleaning is necessary.
Unfortunately, this was at the height of the coronavirus situation when everything started closing.  I know this is his business, but he was very adamant that he would not even compromise on payment for 2 nights that we were going to leave early.  AirBB was much more communicative and helpful."

They stayed and visited local sights.) They said: Pros: If you are attending anything at the Barclay Center, the location can’t be beat.  They were able to find parking on the street, extensive breakfast was a plus, check-in was easy, great communication from the host. They also said it was nice and quiet. Cons: The only issue they experienced, was that the listing had said two beds, but they didn’t even see the second bed the first night (and ended up having to share the Queen), which turned out to only be a blowup mattress located in a common area. I don’t think I would’ve rented this for them if I had known that. They discovered the (not inflated) blow up mattress the second night. Despite the 2nd bed situation, they said they’d stay there again during an A10 conference due to the great location and tasty breakfast! (FYI, I did check the listing before writing this review to make sure I didn’t miss anything, and could not find any mention of the second bed being an uninflated air mattress in a common area. It just said 2 beds.)"

The bed is very comfortable and the building is peaceful and well maintained. One thing to consider is there is no elevator and there is a flight of stairs going up to the sixth floor. We had lots of luggage since we were traveling to Europe from NY but if you travel light, stairs are not all that bad. I would definitely stay here again in the future.

Only issue is that it's about 15min walking distance to the closest subway, and half of the week the music is so loud from the bar downstairs so if you're a light sleeper and staying there long term you will need earplugs.

The apartment is very close to the police department and hospitals, so you will hear an occasional siren but there is a fan in the closet, and I used it while I slept .
There isn't an elevator in the apartment and it's on the 5th floor, so it's all stairs. But, I got some much needed cardio.

The location is very convenient (15 minutes to Manhattan) and safe. Verena was a welcoming host and made my stay feel like home. I would definitely recommend staying here. Wonderful!"
"1694","8287001","621036002",2020-03-27,262966735,"Hovin","There are three comments about the stay. 

First of all, there is no heater in the room. During winter time, it would be very cold since the quilt in the room is not enough to withstand for the cold weather. However, you can ask Sandra and Cary for extra quilt if you need.

Second, the water pressure in the house is low and it seems like a shortage of water. It was happening quite often, the water comes out very slow with little volume, especially in the shower. I have encountered several times that it runs out of water during my shower time, it makes me quite embarrassing. 

Third, the wifi speed is slow quite often. Sometimes I need extra time to load the stuff, no matter on computer or other devices, its somehow annoying. But this situation happens about once or twice a week only. Sometimes the wifi was not working at all and I tried to turn on and off the router again.

For the Q train nearby, it generally takes more than 30 minutes from home to Manhattan and quite a lot of delay. It is better to spare more time if you go to the Broadway or midtown. Sometimes there is no Q train at the weekend and need to find an alternative way to travel around, which is quite inconvenient.

Overall, the stay was comfy and the hosts were very kind. It is a nice stay in Brooklyn since you could find all you need nearby. The place is very clean and neat, you will have a nice experience in the room."

How great! Nora was super helpful with tips about all the area attractions specific to me -- and even showed up with a wonderful treat of amazing, famous of sorts, baked bread from a local bakery. Highly recommend staying here! Great, great access to beach, and yet, literally train ride to the city. Fabulously clean and beautiful home. Thank you Nora!"

We stayed during the Coronavirus outbreak and he really scrubbed down the unit before our stay. Chris' location was perfect as we were helping with a nearby move. Unit has a very firm bed. The bathroom is a tight space. The unit is perfect for folks who are really just using it to sleep at night, but are out and about during most of the day. Friday night was noisy outside for awhile; may have been due to current events. Easy parking in the area, and safe!"

"1702","8339036","620080072",2020-03-20,221753766,"Meg","Sam’s place was absolutely everything we could have asked for. First, in terms of location, it’s a very quick and easy walk to Flatbush Avenue which is on the 2 line or the 5 line (weekdays only). It takes about 30-40 minutes to Manhattan but that’s already explained within the listing details, so it was no surprise to us. It’s also just one line, no transfers for the most part, which was very convenient! Flatbush Ave is also the last stop on the 2 and 5 lines so it’s easy to figure out where you’re going when returning from the city as well. 
Second, cleanliness. I think Sam’s place was incredibly clean and well organized. The kitchen was spotless, the bathroom was spotless as well! 
Third, in terms of amenities, there was plenty of soap in the shower, tea and coffee and pasta among other spices in the kitchen, a Brita water filter in the fridge, and clean dishes and utensils! 
There was also entertainment (amazon prime and Netflix) available which helped for nights where we wanted to stay in and chill! 
There’s a lot of restaurant nearby which was great as well for takeout or delivery. 
And finally, Sam was super communicative about setting up expectations of the place (heating pipes can be loud, it can be cold so an electric heater will be provided, etc.) and was very generous with being flexible with our checkout time. 
I’m so happy we chose to stay at Sam’s place, it was seriously so great!"

Despite the current pandemic, we are grateful Susie let us stay for our duration under the conditions of practicing proper social distancing. It's been a warm home in a pretty active community over the last 2 weeks, even with the current environment being limited to get out and enjoy it. Our goal was to get closer to distant relatives in a trying time- Susie and her parents made it feel like home; they were compassionate and very helpful with getting to know the home. We checked in on a long night's work to an in depth breakdown of the apartment and everything available to us, so that was a pleasant start.

The amenities within are about all that you need, with some cool extras like an air cooler (pun intended) hair dryer, flip flops and plenty space to set up hygiene products, books, etc. The room was a perfect size for my boyfriend and I, and it gets good sunlight and local ambience. 

Kitchen is well equipped with all needed oils, seasonings, pots and and pans. They have a really nice steam cooker that's been our go-to in those relaxing nights. 

The bathroom was clean and supplies were restocked consistently. It takes some difficulty setting up the shower temperature and keeping it cool or hot how you like it, but it's a nice, unique experience. 

Cons: the stairs (but if you're positive, they will provide you with LOTS of EXERCISE!!)

Susie's parents were a delight and we were saddened to have to leave so soon. They provided us with a few snacks during our stay and guided us in the kitchen when we needed help. 

In addition to all of these positive factors, there are bike racks outside where you can lock your bikes AND the apartment is 2 BLOCKS  away from the F train into Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

This was a wonderful spot/apartment to stay and I would come back again.
Susie and her parents are incredible hosts."

Staying at Herman's you should expect someone who is happy to chat about any topic. If you prefer to stay more to yourself, he will give you the space you want. I was anxious about staying at someone's house without knowing the person but I left having acquired a new friend. That is the kind of person Herman is - it doesn't seem to be just about the money for him; he enjoys the opportunity to meet cool and interesting people from all over the world. 

The house is clean and the living room is welcoming, with ""kitty"" always eager to have someone to play with. The walk to the subway/bus is fairly short (about 10min) and there are shops nearby - Herman always drove me to the bigger grocery stores. And the neighborhood is quite safe. If you do book Herman's place, make sure to get him to take you to Manhattan one day - this guy knows a lot about the city and makes for a great guide."

Words cannot describe the spaciousness and vast greenery of Magnolia House. The apartment itself was quite lovely as well -- everywhere I turned, I saw a new book or a glowing antique from a faraway land. There is a small kitchenette outside the porch, where one can sit and look out to the roses, with many goodies stocked. 
Danforth was extraordinarily welcoming, taking many precautions to keep the place tip-top, clean as a whistle, and continually refreshed. On a cool evening, a friendly Franklin stove sung me to sleep. I am a city-dweller; after a hop, skip and a ferry away, I was at the lovely estate.  No subways or bus needed!"
"1738","8589729","627040613",2020-05-31,51945981,"Sidney","This Airbnb experience was astounding. Danforth is an incredible host, and a great storyteller.

The two hosts Darwin and Danforth were formerly major writers for the historical Frommer's Travel Guides for decades, and I have never seen a house anywhere near New York populated by so many amazing items collected from around the world - furniture, statues, Berber rugs, archangelic tablets, Portuguese blessed oxen yokes, a hundred styles of Buddhas, French candleholders, Tibetan mandalas, Chinese chests, Haitian paintings.

Danforth has a green thumb and an enormous willow and many other plants and a multi-layer garden that has been growing for decades provide a beautiful view for the balcony. This side of the house is covered by grapevines. Many trees isolate the space. We drank coffee and listened to the birds and drank in the verdant surroundings for hours.

It is difficult to understate the fantastic history of this place. 1830s. Anais Nin hung out here. Tennessee Williams was interviewed for his biography here. They have a bed that belonged to Teddy Roosevelt. Mercedes de Acosta was interviewed here in 1968. The whole block I believe is a landmark district, and the house is close to both the water and the oldest (enormous) Catholic Church in Staten Island.

We loved falling asleep near a warm fireplace.

Danforth made many special arrangements to accommodate the Covid crisis and was unerringly clean. We had many needs catered to - more needs and wants than we expected to be catered and maybe some we did not even know could be. Normally the hosts serve breakfast directly, but due to the pandemic they made other arrangements to offer wonderful and borderline unreasonable amounts of food. We were also given liquor, a full refrigerator of other goodies, and some good stories."

Some of the things that stand out about William are strong communication (he is very responsive and actively checks in during the stay). Additionally William went above and beyond, as this stay was during COVID in NYC, to check if I needed anything towards the end of my stay, and gave mes some flexibility with the check-out time to help me move out. This is also a really fun neighborhood, and you are literally a 2 minute walk from the B, D trains (and Canal street is 2 min the other way).

The apartment is as described. There is a small common area with a kitchenette and kitchen table, and the entrance hall has a small seating bench with a good view over the window. One other room was a guest from AirBNB, and the third room was William's permanent apartment-mate.  This apartment-mate is often traveling, so you often get to have the apartment with just one other guest."

The bed was comfortable and the extra room was perfect for my pre-teen on weekends she visited. Beverly provided silverware dinner plates, and cookware.  There were even some seasonings for cooking. She even welcomed me with a bottle of wine :-).

The neighborhood was great! Bed-Stuy is rich in history and there are amazing restaurants (Peaches is a most) within a few blocks of the Airbnb. The subway station is a straight forward 10 minute walk at an easy pace and got me into the financial district in under 20 mins. I would certainly stay again in the future. Thanks again Beverly!

Spread Love,  it's the Brooklyn way!"

It was my first time ever coming to NYC (and I was alone) so safety and comfort were very important to me. This area is probably one of (if not the) safest in Brooklyn and I never felt uncomfortable walking around by myself, day or night. I came during the covid pandemic so unfortunately restaurants were closed except for take out, but during normal times, you have a plethora of restaurant and bar options. You’re a couple blocks from Prospect Park, a beautiful, large park to go running, walking, etc. and close to all public transport (subway, bus). The apartment was beautiful and a perfect size for me (or a couple). It was very clean and updated and has great sunlight coming through the windows. The bed is extremely comfortable! And because it’s on the 4th floor, it’s quiet! I highly recommend this place for single or couple travelers wanting a safe, comfortable place to stay in a neighborhood with lots of food and bev options and also the space to get outside and enjoy the Brooklyn weather and culture! I would go back in a heartbeat!"

 Terrible to communicate with tho. I am a frontline ER worker and started my stay with Sandy for 2 weeks to check it out, and thought it was great - and wanted to stay! I asked for an extension and properly filed for the remainder of my 3 month stay at the rate she had posted. I checked back several times for confirmation and never got a direct answer. She kept stringing me along. Finally out of desperation, with the help of the airbnb support team, she FINALLY declined my extension request at 7:30 pm on the last day of the 2 weeks and I had to vacate by 11 the next morning!! I found out she booked another guest who requested it AFTER I had requested the extension. Sandy had 5 days she could have let me know I needed to get ready to move and adjust my work commitment I had made - but Sandy did not.
She is the owner. I get it, she can do whatever she wants. But this was a terrible reflection of who she is a person!
I was very clear, upfront and with plenty of notice about my schedule at work. This situation had so much room for a better outcome, but Sandy selfishly chose to only seek what SHE wanted.
 Here I am - a guest in the community, volunteering my health and life to assist the Coney Island population as they suffer and die - without family at their side - during this pandemic - and now I have to pack and find housing and move all in 16 hours time.  Never mind me personally and the emotional toll I was barely balancing, Now I had to call off work to accommodate Sandy kicking me out. How about all those new patients needing critical help coming into the ER? How about my already exhausted colleagues who needed the extra hands to help them?  This experience has broken my spirit about human kindness. Thank you Sandy.
By the way, the oven does not heat past 185 degrees, the coffee pot has a constant alarm while plugged in, the tub drain will not hold water, and the first day I was there as part of my sanitation safety routine I moped the floor - the mop water was brown/black. 

True story. Every bit of it is documented on the messages section between myself and Sandy (Website hidden by Airbnb) But the place is easy to wipe down - if thats all you care about."

But this 2 months had been simply amazing. I loved my cozy and quite room, had everything I needed in the Kitchen. It is a very good spot to live: near the Metro that you don't hear, everything to shop is near and one of my favorites, the Café cup of brooklyn. You can have wonderful walks through the area Bushwick and Bedford. Carlos and Carmen are one of the nicest persons I know. If I had a question or anything, Carmen and Carlos, if at home, were there asap. I really felt at home far away from home in Germany and was more than sad to leave! Gracias por todo!"

The room was so nice and cozy and even had a desk to work at so it felt like home right from day one! Also: the bed was literal heaven, I miss the mattress already :D The entire flat was so beautifully and thoughtfully decorated and the bathroom was absolutely clean always! Location wise it couldn’t have been better either as you have the best of both worlds as I’d say: the cool down to earth vibe of Williamsburg with all the little unique bars and restaurants  and on the other hand just a couple of stops away from bustling midtown Manhattan - getting around was never an issue.

The kitchen is well-stocked with equipment for preparing meals, having two beds plus a futon couch makes for plenty of comfort, and the bathroom is beautiful.

However, the downside is the lack of cleanliness. The apartment was extremely dirty. My husband and I took photos when we arrived but AirBnB doesn’t allow you to post photos. There were crumbs and hairs in the bed sheets. We bought all new bedding and left it there. The shower had mold between all the tiles so we bought bleach and did a deep clean of the bathroom. The floors of the apartment were very dirty. We tried using the vacuum available but it didn’t pick anything up. The dishes in the cabinet were all dirty. Some had pieces of food stuck on them. From all the AirBnB’s we’ve been to, we’ve never experienced anything like this. 
Also, make sure to carefully read all house rules. If you open house rules, scroll down and click “show more” there is a $30 charge per night for any guest who stays the night. We didn’t realize that and had booked the apartment for 4 months with plans to have our family visit for a few days, in the second bedroom."

La dueña del departamento nos dejó de obsequio unas manzanas dos botellitas de agua y tres sobres de sopa. Al llegar percibimos un tremendo olor a orin de gato el que se sintió durante toda nuestra estadía no resultando para nada agradable. La pileta ( lavamanos) del baño estaba tapado y nos mandó tres días después una persona que la destapó. Nosotros nos retiramos del departamento dos días antes de la fecha programada puesto que adelantamos el vuelo para volver a nuestro país."

He was very good with communication and I had no problem until I left a day early because of the virus and my difference from that day was $186 and he declined to refund it bc “he wouldn’t be able to pay his rent” ??? You obviously Airbnb so sureeee. I could see if the amount was less than $100 but it’s not and the day at the airbnb wasn’t used. He offered travel discount but honestly I’m not interested in booking this Airbnb again bc of his inability to help the situation as well as the size of the apartment."

L'emplacement est parfait pour un séjour dans Manhattan, c'est un quartier résidentiel calme mais avec toutes les commodités, restaurants, supermarchés, métro a 3 minutes a pieds, bus au bout de la rue. Très proche de plusieurs musée et attractions a pieds et en métro.
Encore merci pour ce séjour et à bientôt peut être :)
Thanks again Claudio and be safe

Be aware that there are a lot of stairs to get to the apartment. They are also very narrow so it’s hard to bring up large bags/suitcases. 

Place wasn’t as cleanly as hoped for. 
William the roommate was reserved and mostly quiet throughout the later part of the day, but he made the living conditions of the place very unsanitary and filthy. 

Room does have a large plant inside of it which takes up space. Also, even though the room has a lock, a key for it was never provided which was a bit unsettling knowing that the door can never be locked from the outside when going out somewhere.

Despite the host living in Portugal, he did a good job communicating and resolving conflicts. He was very understanding and tried his best to accommodate us to the best of his abilities."

Communication was great as well. She's so nice! Thumps up to that. (People are not nice now a days, very hard to find like people like her) Double thumps up to that!!! 
Everything was clean! As soon as you step inside the apartment you can smell nothing but a good scent. I loved walking in the apartment that smells mad good. That’s a bonus and thumps up to that. 
The apartment was very clean! She takes care of her place. It makes sense why she’s a SUPER HOST.  Hooraaaay to that 
 
The room I was staying in was very comfortable. The bed was comfortable as well. The blanket was warm also. The towel was a softer than mine haha. Bathroom was very very clean! Even though I never used the kitchen (just passed by it) it was spotless. I was very happy with my stay! Although I was always outside, I've never got the chance to meet her. Great neighborhood by the way. Lots of spots out here. It's a safe neighborhood as well. If you want to take the train, it’s literally right there. You’ll like the walk also the neighborhood too. Parking was good too. I was surprised.
She also gave me local tips on where to go. Which saved lots of time! I appreciate you for that! She made my stay very comfortable.

(Covid times) It was my greatest chance to stay at her house during this difficult period. In this beautiful house, everything is complete, Aliza is very clean, tidy and helpful. She cooks delicious foods and the house smells very nice every day. It was a wonderful experience for me, like staying with family. I’ve spend three beautiful weeks in New York and now I have many beautiful memories and a very close friend. The house is located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood in Brooklyn. It takes a maximum of 30 minutes to go to the center, public transportation is 5-10 minutes away. Returning to this house has always made me happy, as well as visiting New York. I believe that someone who stays in this house will stay here every time he/she comes to NY. I definitely recommend and I wish I’ll be back again. My sweet second home! :)"

Check-in: one of the best Airbnb check-in experiences we have ever had. Eric met us in person and showed us around the flat, including all of the mod-cons (e.g. a huge TV, an Alexa with smart lighting etc) and explained to us the best ways to get to Manhattan and what to do in the neighbourhood.
Location: perfect to explore the city - you can be by Central Park in a short subway ride and the location in general is very safe.

A 10/10 experience highly Recommend."

Eric is very thoughtful and offers you with all the necessary things you need and MORE! From the moment you walk through the door to the very back yard it has thoughtful touches. To sweeten the deal Eric offers you with full privacy and does not bother you at all! He is not strict about noise level. (I’m assuming the basement is sound insulated). Once he is done giving you the tour the apartment is yours! Thanks again Eric"

Ich würde dieses Apartment immer wieder wählen. Es ist groß und sauber und perfekt ausgestattet. Auch die Lage ist perfekt:  in einer relativ neuen Gegend mit vielen Familien, es ist ruhig und sicher. Es gibt einige Restaurants und Bars in der Nähe, auch der Supermarkt ist nur zwei Straßen entfernt. In Manhattan ist man mit der nahegelegenen Subway 7 in wenigen Minuten. Jim ist der geborene Gastgeber, er reagiert schnell auf Nachrichten und hat uns bei Ankunft empfangen und uns durch das Viertel geführt. 

Tipp: Unbedingt mit der Ferry zu Roosevelt Island und von dort aus mit der Tram rüber nach Manhattan. Wunderbarer Blick auf die Skyline!! 

Thanks Jim, we really enjoyed our stay. Everything was just perfect. Clean and cosy. We really felt at home :) Best wishes from Hamburg, Germany."

Annie went out of her way to help me settle in, even before I arrived by helping me with directions and giving me tips each day for living in New York. She is great company and cares about you and your stay with her.

The room is lovely and comfortable with lots of light with space to hang and store things. The apartment is clean and cosy, a home away from home.

I found the travel into Manhattan every straight forward and quick, the closest subway line is about an 8 minute walk. 

Lastly, her legendary dog, Wylie, is adorable. He is very loving and loves a good pat. 

Overall my stay has been brilliant and I can’t thank Annie enough for making my first trip to New York so great."

Victoria and Alex (co-hosts) are very friendly and helpful- whatever question or a request we had they were always there for us.  Would definitely recommend and book again."

We had a nice conversation and it was the first air bnb in a looong time where I actually got to meet the host. The apartment was a clean and comfy home base. The LES is quieter and calmer than other parts of the city but still central and very easy to get around. It was close to an above ground train so there was some rumbling but I live across from train tracks and find it very soothing. If you’re a light sleeper/ not used to city noise be aware. We slept in the front bedroom by the street so the room further from the street is probably quieter. All in all, good NYC value. Great location. Sandra gave us some good restaurant recommendations and we had a very nice, chill weekend. Big love, stay safe & heathy out there folks!"

I am only sorry that the corona virus made it necessary to return home earlier than intended. The apartment is charming, sunny, and perfectly located on the Upper West Side. The large living room window of the apartment overlooks the garden and also has a working fireplace for the colder winter nights. The city is extremely accessible, with public transport of all stripes (subways for different lines, buses) and supermarkets (Trader Joe's and Whole Foods), cafés, restaurants and many of the best museums (Natural History, Guggenheim, the Met, Neue Gallerie)  within walking distance from this vintage brownstone building. There is also a washer and dryer available at no cost in the building. Although the area is expensive, Trader Joe's and various bodegas make it possible to live well.  Harry and Jill were extraordinarily welcoming, very hospitable and flexible hosts. I enjoyed their kind and lively hospitality  at their home (directly above the apartment) and will very much miss living at #3 (which in many ways is now synonymous with New York City for me). I will most certainly visit them when next in New York, no matter how far into the future that may currently seem to be!"

Bianca is an aggressive and disrespectful host  and it was a bad experience - there were MICE running in the apartment.  Absolutely Disgusting (Website hidden by Airbnb) Mice in the kitchen,  running on the stove (Website hidden by Airbnb) Mice in the living room, behind the couch (Website hidden by Airbnb) Mice in the bedroom, with droppings and mice urine near where we sleep. We have video and photos of all of it, sent to Airbnb (Website hidden by Airbnb) Bianca lives there and admitted to know about the problem, she deals with it with glue traps, instead of fixing it with a professional that will catch the mice in cages, seal the holes so they won't keep coming and professionally CLEAN/ DISINFECT the place so she can invite guests that won’t experience what we had to.  She bought us traps to catch the mice, saying they were expensive, the traps did not work; we checked the price- 4 dollar each. After we saw the urine and the mice excrement – it was too much! We asked to move, but not before we get a refund for the days we won’t be there- Bianca communicated in an aggressive, violent manner that was shocking to us – ""Get out of my apartment!!!"", ""I don't want you there!"","" I am busy, you deal with Airbnb!"", she also thought that because of our argument we are gonna damage or steal from her apartment - we have screenshots of all, everything was sent to the case manager who allowed us to move out (after two days of phone calls, stress and disrespectful attitude of the host, who obviously just wanted to take our money but did not see us as her guests/customers, more like a nuisance). In addition, the apartment is noisy because it is near a liquor store with people hanging out there day and night under the bedroom window.  They also smoke weed and the smell is coming in to the house.  Please pay attention as we have no reason to lie about any of this, her apartment was open to new reservations right after we moved – so no treatment and cleaning was done."

Unfortunately, my wife and I were not able to stay at Char's, due to the coronavirus.  We had planned to still go when it was still in it's early stages, but had to make a difficult decision last minute to not go.  However, Char seemed as compassionate as she was professional.  She was completely understanding of the situation, and communicated with us clearly while helping us along the way with cancelling the trip.  We hope we get the chance in the future for her to host our stay in NYC, because I have yet to try some authentic New York pizza

PSA: The space was clean...The space was CLEAN! (And I'm a neat freak) All the necessities were provided, plus more! The bed was comfy, room temperature perfect, and most importantly, it was quiet. (Yes, that's a perk of staying on an island in NYC)

Ammenities were a lifesaver while I was working. Everything was well supplied, new - honestly this whole flat is just gorgeous and thoughtfully remodeled. The bed was super comfortable. They truly thought of everything, down to cleaning supplies and a hairdryer! I was so comfortable there, and it allowed me to get the rest I needed on the few days I had off.

Artie was also very communicative during our stay and responded to our questions promptly.  We also had an unfortunate change of plans but Artie was able to accommodate us.

I highly recommend Artie’s place if you’re looking for a place and planning to check out all the sites.  We hope to return again in the future."

"2094","11146432","618086643",2020-03-14,65677829,"James","The location was nice, close to a lot of stores and restaurants, and seemed like a pretty safe neighborhood. The check in process was pretty quick and simple; one of the hosts were very thorough in explaining everything regarding check in and check out. The other two hosts seem to be pretty great chefs considering how good the brunch they were preparing smelled. I had to leave before breakfast so I couldn’t really get to enjoy the actual brunch. They also offer tea and coffee 24/7 which is nice. They also had some muffins and nuts for snacks if that’s what you’re into. 

The building is pretty old like in the description. The stairs to the fourth floor is slanted, which was a bit concerning but if their building code is up to date with inspections, I suppose it’s not necessarily alarming.

If it wasn’t clear in the descriptions, the WHOLE building is shared by four hosts that rent using Airbnb. There are rooms on each floor that guests use for Airbnb. It was nice that the bathrooms were available on all four floors so that you don’t necessarily need to wait to use the bathrooms.

The fourth floor host or perhaps it was one of the guests invited me to watch a movie with them (which was really nice of them!) but it was pretty loud and the doors don’t really block out all the noise so I had a bit of hard time falling asleep. Also, people walking up the stairs could be heard because it squeaks pretty loudly. 

There’s no AC in the room as described in the amenities. The only reprieve is the cold outside winter air. If you have a hard time falling asleep due to noise and heat, this is not a great place for you. You’d have to keep the window open to stay cool enough but you’d have to deal with NYC noise outside as well as other guests making noise. 

The space was pretty clean; the hosts seem to be very hygiene oriented. They have soap and hand sanitizers ready and available, super nice considering this virus that’s going around. They said the sheets and pillows are cleaned as well as the room before the guests arrive. 
The bathroom was clean and the water pressure is decent."

The check in was smooth and and the house keeper was there to meet us. The only offputting thing when we first arrived were the amount of tramps outside of the apartment living on the street and in some waste land right next to the apartments entrance. Really scary. We were also a bit surprised to see the apartment was right next to the busway with loads of buses constantly going up the bus ramp. We had thought the listing was near Times Square, but really it was very close to the west side highway and Lincoln tunnel. Had I have known this, I would not have booked this apartment in this location. Especially for the high price we paid. The bathrooms were beautiful and the kitchen was well appointed. The bedrooms were neat and tidy and we each had our own room. There were four of us travelling. One big complaint were the electrics in the apartment. We all got a little shock each time we turned the lights on. Also one of the bedrooms didn’t have any light switches in it. You either had to put your hand through a little hole in the wall (through ti the next door bedroom) or go into another bedroom to turn on the bloody light. Ludicrous... Also, the same bedroom had a door that wouldn’t close so we had to jam a suitcase against it for privacy reasons. On a positive note, the apartment was super clean, with loads of towels and assorted bath amenities, such as shampoo body wash etc. This was a nice touch. The kitchen cupboards had coffee and tea with sugar and a couple of other staple ingredients too, such as salt and pepper and oil. This was a positive too. Lounge room had a nice couch and large screen TV with Netflix and there was also a dining table. A big complaint about the apartment was the amount of noise from the busway and Tunnel traffic and also the fitness centre located right below the apartment. If you don’t mind being woken at 6 am each day with loud noise from the instructor shouting instructions from a microphone and loud music, then you’re okay, however we weren’t okay with this, because it was very loud and very disturbing after a long day in New York City. We were unable to sleep in the mornings later than 6am and at night we were kept awake by the constant flow of buses outside of our window. There were always lots of tramps (as previously mentioned) sleeping outside the building daily. We had an old lady staying with us and she was really scared in the evenings when we returned in either an Uber or taxi. They constantly asked for money and many of them were either drugged or drunk. Because of this aspect and the noise, I would not recommend this apartment if you want a rest and to be in a good neighbourhood in New York City. For the price I paid, I expected it to be much nicer. One was a great communicator and did allow us to check out one hour later. On the whole the apartment itself was lovely, but as I mentioned, there was some serious things wrong."

"2194","11969727","621919485",2020-04-06,9106232,"Tiffany","A few friends and myself stayed at One's place for a change of scenery and a lil birthday acknowledgment for a friend. The apartment was clean and just as nice as the pictures depicted. We had a great time. The only issues were that I believe check out (10am) is too early especially if you are not catching a early flight or have to leave early for other reasons. Most airbnbs that I've stayed in have always had a check out of 11:30 or later. The bus depot ramp is located next to the building and can be a bit noisy at night or early in the AM. All in all we still had an awesome time. I must give Patricia -the house manager a shout out. She helped us with our bags up the stairs and was just so pleasant and accommodating. Thanks again One, for providing a great space to stay during this very precarious time."

The apartment is huge for NYC standards, clean, modern and very comfortable. The building is quiet and well-kept, with even a free laundry in the basement. 
Also, the location is simply amazing: you have anything you might need within a five minutes walk (supermarket, gym,  restaurants...) and the neighborhood is safe and lively. A big plus is how easy is to go downtown: the subway is just around the corner, and with the express train it doesn't takes long at all.
David is really an amazing host, very attentive to our needs, and ready to do anything is possible to make sure that our stay was pleasant. 
We were a bit unfortunate, because our last two months in NYC were affected by the pandemic, but staying at David's place made the experience much better: I was able to work from home without issues and the apartment was so good that we lived the stay-at-home experience without feel uncomfortable. 

 I definitely recommend staying here!"

Nit picks. And I mean small nit picks! WiFi could be stronger. WiFi does not work in the bedrooms or bathroom. So if you stream your music or depend on high speed internet it gets the job done with some limitations. 
Full streaming with Amazon Firestick provides with large screen TV.

Then was greeted by a huge puddle of what was sure to be pee next to the apartment door on the second floor. Usually I wouldn’t blame that on the host but he has 3 other units along with this one in that building (which is majority of the units in the building if not all) You would think he would have better upkeep of the building; Definitely with what’s going on right now. We walk into the apartment which wasn’t bad for the most part until we found out one of the ac units were broken and we were not told about that before checking in. I feel like that information should’ve have been passed along from the beginning. But we called the host (Adam) about the broken ac and he said yea it’s out of service do you mind opening a window. It was so muggy and disgusting but luckily Adam later texted us that there’s a second unit in the bedroom corner that works. We turned on the ac and open the windows and let the ac spread but it was so muggy and disgusting we left to let the apartment cool off to then come back to be greeted by a bunch of mosquitos that used us as their chewing toys all night long. It was a sucky way to sleep. And to top it off just expect to open the microwave with a chopstick"

- Read place description carefully - the two beds are single beds, I couldn't roll over lest I fall (and the spring mattresses are rather uncomfortable). I would rather use pull-out couch in the living room next time.
- The forced air heat/cool was loud when turned on, I had a lot of Cape Canaveral dreams during the night.
- Shower pressure could be better."

La chambre est parfaitement propre avec 2 grands lits et plus grande qu'elle n'en a l'air sur les photos. Comme la chambre est dans un grand loft il y a peu de lumière naturelle dans la chambre, mais c'est un détail comparé au confort des lits, de la grande salle de bain à notre disposition et de la cuisine tout équipée. On s'est régalées dans les petits restos à prix abordable aux alentours de la maison. 2 lignes de métro à proximité dont un aérien qui emmène direct à Manhattan en 30 à 40 minutes suivant le temps d'attente, tout en admirant la ville !

First up, JE's place is awesome re travel accessibility (we were traveling via car, but train and bus stops were all within a 3 to 5 minute walk away, along with a TON of nearby places to eat). Secondly, the studio comes as described with amenities, but wait... there's more! The studio comes with a pile of current movies that were all under consideration for awards in recent years, a motif that will leave you smacking your lips (literally), and little touches all over the studio that were amazing! (In particular, we LOVED the sewing kit from a post-Soviet hotel in Kazakhstan.) Lastly, but only because I'm sensing that I'm becoming longwinded, JE was a great host that kept communication rolling and was available for questions and concerns. I'd recommend this again without hesitation."

She responded promptly to our texts and questions and was flexible about our timing. The apartment is well appointed, the kitchen has been thoughtfully stocked and  the location is very convenient to the beautiful park, shops, restaurants, etc.
We would definitely recommend this to others and we hope to come back some day when the world is not in such a turbulent time."

Easy to find street parking and easy walking or biking to get to anywhere you need to go and close to subway too although I never did use the subway due to covid 19.

Jane Anne left me outside of her unit for two hours after check-in. She promissed the code to the lockbox and never responded to my calls or messages. After waiting two hours I decided to tug at the lockbox and found that it was opened with no key inside. I knocked on the door to the unit I had already rented and paid for and to my suprise there was already a guest in the unit. She said she was there for a week and that Jane was going to inform her if there were any scheduled guest. She offered to leave and I said no thank you! Was I suppose to just walk in right after the previous guest without it being cleaned? If the previous guest over stayed her welcome what happened to the cleaning crew that was supposed to clean up after the previous guest? Why was Jane ignoring my calls and messages?

My stay didn't quite measure up to my own personal expectations, however through no fault of Mike's, it was during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020. I wasn't able to experience any of what Lower Manhattan had to offer for the 2 months I was there, other than an eerily quiet Financial District, so unfortunately I can't comment on the scene from an tourist's standpoint. There were several grocery stores within a 5 minute walk, however, and cooking-in was an easy endeavor. I would return again."

I didn’t get the room that included the futon couch. Instead I got a room that hadn’t been cleaned before I arrived that also included a mouse that wanted to party all night. I tried to look past this & sleep in the fold up chair that was provided. Once that was a fail, I decided to lay on the towels on the bed, which was even worse because now I not only smelled that the bedding wasn’t clean, I saw remnants from the last guest. When I expressed this, the host immediately went to defense mode saying it was my fault that I didn’t check the bedding. It never looked inviting to begin with which is why I attempted to settle for sleeping on the fold up chairs. He never explained the location difference nor the mouse. It would really suck to have avoided the virus this long only to catch it from someone’s negligence of cleaning. I want to still support small business owners through the pandemic but we all have to do our part & do better. XoXo"

"2414","13117282","619868772",2020-03-19,149378555,"Martina","Sasha's apartment is in terrible condition. In the photos, it is not noticeable, because they were probably taken when the apartment was recently renovated and painted. It is a basement with a series of problems that I mention below. The entrance of the house has rotten wooden stairs, so it smells musty. There is moisture on the walls and water often falls when it is very cold outside and the heating is turned on. The house often makes noise, from the water and the heating pipes. There are holes in the corners of the house, from which animals (such as rats) could have entered. During the first week in the apartment, we had serious issues, such as the absence of hot water caused by the failure of the boiler. We had to go into the boiler room and try to light the heater with a lighter, kneeling on the floor full of dust and dirt, along with other neighbors who did not have hot water either. During our stay, the electricity in one part of the house also went out, so the plugs did not work. As a result, we couldn’t use the heaters in the 2-bedroom room because the room was very cold and it was almost impossible to sleep there.
Speaking of cleaning, when we got to the apartment, it was very dirty. The floor was sticky, the kitchen was full of rice stuck to the shelves, there was grease on the walls of the whole dining room and dust - a lot of dust. The pots and pans were completely burned and unusable. We had to go buy everything we needed and ask for a refund ($ 88, money that, by the way, I still haven't seen in my bank account). The house was so dirty that we asked Sasha to call a cleaner to clean it properly: the first time, a girl came who did everything (eat, talk, sing, use the restroom) less than clean. The second time a guy came in and cleaned decently (but not very thoroughly either) and charged us $ 235 (money that Sasha sent me again, but I haven't seen yet in my bank account). In the house there is no dishwasher, nor laundry (but this is common in the US) or television, the oven does not work and the internet works very badly, especially when there are many people in the building.
Positive things? Sasha is very diplomatic and tries to justify the flaws in the house all the time, so he answers messages very quickly. We never saw him in person, but his boyfriend did appear (he even came one of the first nights to see if the apartment was indeed as dirty as we said). Sasha was very nervous when we repeated for the 3rd time that we did not have hot water at home (something essential, given that in New York in January it is very cold). I quote his words verbatim: ""If you think you understand the details how to manage and maintain a building in New York better than us, and better than the whole team of technicians we employ, then you're welcome to go somewhere else. I'm sure you can find a better building and save your technical advice and your insults for your next landlord. and I'm sure we can find a less anxious tenant who understands how hard we are working and how quickly and professionally we respond (like everyone in the building except you) "".
If I went back, I would never be at Sasha's again. The first two weeks were a total waste of time insisting that he fix our house problems.
The positive thing is the price because in New York everything is very expensive. To be the Bronx, the area is not dangerous: you just have to adapt a little to the environment. It is also well connected to the D train, although this line is often delayed or even closed by police controls.

She offered us a temporary apt type deal but the deal eventually was just “give me first months rent and security and pay for the rest of this month and also I might kick you out in a month so it’s your call” lol. So I guess just don’t make deals outside of Airbnb with her she doesn’t seem to be very reliable. And because i got convinced into getting only a week I spent more than I had wanted when I could’ve just booked for a month through Airbnb and gotten a better bang for my buck. Also, she doesn’t charge for an extra person, I had originally put on Airbnb I was looking for a stay for 2 people and when she sent me the premise reservation I booked it without realizing it said one person rather than two. She had an issue with that for I don’t really understand what reason we were very quiet guests and kept the place well.  We apologized for it but we saw in the deal later she took some aggression out with giving us a bogus “deal”. So yeah. Just don’t make off Airbnb deals with this host. Other than that the stay was good and the room was very cute."

I enjoyed how convenient the location is, 1 -2 min walking distance to the major subway station, 5-7 min to Trader Joe’s, 10-15 min to Whole Foods, 10 min or so to East River Park and plenty deli’s restaurants on the street and at the corners. 

The flat itself is simple and clean. It is tiny but it is standard for NYC. It is the second floor so that it was not too hard for me to get my suitcases up. 

I didn’t mind the piled up trash at the stair entrance. The code-required entrance makes me feel safe. The building is an old tenement building, and the walls are super thin; I could hear when the dog barked, when kids cried, when someone climbed the stairs or talked on the phone. However, if you spend most of your time out, this may not be a big deal. 

The bottom line is that it is a convenient, clean and safe place. Thank you Mina for having me."

Also, it’s only 8 minutes away from the four or five train line. However, I booked for a longer stay and discovered that there was a mice issue. Granted this is an older industrial building and it’s located on the fifth floor. For a hefty cleaning fee, I expected a rodent free environment. I had to cut my trip short and reside elsewhere. Another downfall is you can hear everything inside of the loft because the walls are paper thin. There is a local grocery store near by but’s the quality is average. The host responds in a timely fashion to all your questions. This experience wasn’t awful but there are more affordable and better deals for less."

Big surprise, when I arrived there, not only to mention the fact that the apartment was really smaller than expected in the photos, but also her neighbors warned me that the apartment was very dangerous for my family because it was situated at the center of the pandemic… So I got scared and I decided to leave immediately, I did not even stay 30 min, this is how we got into conflict for questions of reimbursement, and she even felt comfortable to ask me to give her half of the money because ""she was going to have a hard time renting her apartment due to the current situation""… I found this experience meaningless and dishonest, we shouldn't put dollars on human lives."

Really great location right near the L train and happening spot for art, eateries and bars in Bushwick.

I was nervous to visit NY during the pandemic, but the place seemed very clean and he cleaned and left it empty ahead of time so no one had been in the unit recently.  I also was so glad that there was no shared ventilation with other apartments--the heat is radiator and the AC is a window unit.  And the location was perfect so I could walk to my doctor's appointments in midtown without using cabs or public transit.  Also, there is lots of street parking nights and weekends to unload luggage and the rest of the time I parked three blocks away at a self-park garage (the Park-and-Lock) because I didn't want anyone getting in my  to valet it.  Because of the convenient location lots of places deliver as well, so you just don't have to worry about going into any other buildings.  I think this is as safe as you could find in Manhattan!  The bed was also comfortable and I enjoyed the sunshine cooking through the big windows in the afternoons since I couldn't be out and about."

The appartment is quite good but stay in contact with tim and gina if you have questions. They really care and will help you out in any way possible. Tim even sent me messages to check in on me and ask if I was doing ok, which I greatly appreciated!

We were in NY this past weekend when the world changed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This meant we literally couldn’t go anywhere social in the evening, so after walking many miles in Manhattan and Brooklyn we were relieved and happy to spend the evenings relaxing at Yana’s. The beds are super comfortable, the kitchen well equipped and the living area felt spacious for the 2 of us. The apartment is clean and well looked after, only very minor niggle are the bedroom curtains that let in light. The building is old and a little shabby in places, but everything worked and we felt safe in our little socially distanced haven!
When things are normal the local area looks amazing, bars and restaurants and shops etc. We did find a brilliant wine store nearby too - The Smiling Violet on Borinquen Pl. Lastly, definitely get a slice of pizza from Zeff’s a few doors down from the apartment building, so good!  

Thanks Yana, we will come back when NY is open again."

The area is lively and feels safe. It's very easy and relatively quick to get into Manhattan (about 30mins on the subway). The apartment was pleasant and has everything you'll need for a long stay. I was there during coronavirus lockdown so it's a little tricky to comment too much on what goes on in the area as everything was shut. I would say though that during a fairly stressful time Patrick and his lady Diana were terrific at keeping in touch and making sure I was ok. It was much appreciated and shows what kind and caring hosts they are. Would definitely look them up again if/when I can return to NY."

The apartment itself has all the facilities you would need, with a launderette within the building. The bed is super comfy too!

I will definitely be back.  Thank you to Vik and his beautiful family!!"

There were tips for the different bus connections and flyers about New York. Everything was as described in the advertisement. 
We enjoyed being guests here."
"2582","13911729","624951554",2020-05-16,11583267,"Steph","Wonderful stay in Brooklyn despite the COVID-19 craziness. My wife and I drove from ATL within a few days notice for me to work at NYU Langone ER to help with covid response. Andy was generous and understanding of the situation. We really appreciated his hospitality. 

Things to note: 

If staying for more than a few days expect to take some time making room in the fridge for your items (if take out everyday isn’t a thing for you.) 

We are coffee addicts and there is a small french press available, but if you like more than one cup at a time bring a larger press (we didn’t bother to ask Andy if he had a larger one, we just made it work—no biggie). 

The patio is a shared space, ask for details regarding any rules or concerns. My wife did some stretching on a yoga mat; however, there was concern from a neighbor about sweating on the ground. 

Overall, we would recommend this place for any and all! The projector made movie nights even better. The decor is unforgettable. Not to mention, you’re steps away from food, parks and water! Thank you, Andy!"

I was fortunate to book here during the pandemic while the city was on pause and working remotely, it was a blessing to have lighting fast internet and cable tv to keep our sanity.

There are some great takeaway food places very close, as well as being able to order in. 
John and Ainslie and their 2 adult children (& gorgeous little cat Muffin ) are a lovely family. You need to be ok with sharing facilities and common spaces. There is a very steep high staircase for those that struggle."

If you want a warm and memorable stay, then Natalie’s a classic ‘film noir’ host whose certainly worth saying yes to."

The location is absolutely amazing and they've done a great job remodeling the space into a spacious lounge, two great bedrooms and a really special bathroom with a wonderful steam shower and oversize tub, beautifully tiled and equipped with underfloor heating. 

There was super fast WiFi and cable TV plus access to the back garden, which was totally perfect as we had our Bernedoodle puppy staying with us. 

We had a truly wonderful time and would most certainly stay here again.

Prospect Park is just a few minutes stroll away as are all the shops and eateries of 7th Avenue."

You can tell she really thought about her guests when she set up on the place. The area itself has everything you need within walking distance, and is just a 5 minute walk to two different train stops.

I am very appreciative of Makiko's hospitality - she made sure that the check-in was easy and had friends' contact info in case I needed everything. She was also very communicative. I rented this unit right before the COVID situation escalated in NY, and her hospitality and accommodations put me at ease during a time of uncertainty, which I really appreciated.

The room was quite big and very chic. Everything was clean and we always had the possibility to get fresh towels. We had access to a Smart TV with cable programs. 
The bathroom is shared with the room next door (also for Airbnb).
We had full access to the kitchen (+ equipment) and the living room, both of which are beautifully furnished.
The room itself was a bit clairaudient, but during the night this was no problem as the apartment is not located in a noisy area. 
The location is nice if you can live with taking the metro every day (45 minutes to Times Square). The metro station is about 5 minutes walking distance from the apartment."

Also many entertainment options, Netflix, ABC etc. - everything was catered for. Laundry and dryer also included so it was extremely convenient. Instructions were clear, check in/out was easy. The only minor thing to note is that the apartment is located on a 5th floor of a walk up, so bringing 2 large luggages up took a while and requires some good fitness!

It was only a short walk to several Metro stations which provided all the major services in and around Manhattan. The Barclays Centre was only 10 minutes away. Marjorie is an amazing onsite host who always displays her special care of her visitors and is a fabulous ambassador for the neighbourhood. The apartment is comfortable, the security is high and the amenities provide for all needs. There is a full size fridge, washing machine and dryer. The wifi was extremely fast and I was impressed with how Chromecast easily worked with our iPad and streaming services. At times I missed live TV to keep abreast of what was happening in the news, but the internet did this okay. The front stairs to the entry door are steep but manageable. We are both in our late 50s and quickly sorted out an assisted method to help my wife down to the pavement. We visited for two weeks in March and during that time we witnessed the rapid escalation of the coronavirus pandemic in NYC. Marjorie regularly checked in with us about our health and safety as we did with her. We definitely recommend Majorie’s apartment and her super host status."

On arrival i has I trouble finding the key, I had just arrived in town with my two kids from the airport it was around 10pm, I called the host and asked for instructions on finding the key he was very rude and unprofessional and kept telling me read the instructions. The next night there in the hall way everyday moving foward I smelt marijuana coming from the 1st apartment, my kids had to smell that horrible drug also every night the guy in the 3rd apartment was making lots of noises stumping and beating on things, mind you my wife works at a hospital 12 hour shifts and she had to be disturbed out of her sleep because of  the very disrespectful tenant in apartment 3, we had been there 14 days and the whole stay was horrible, the bathroom in the kitchen had a leak from the faucet I reported it to the host and he told me to put a towel down because now one can be reached because of the covid-19. The sheets on the second bed was real dirty. I reported the floors not being cleaned to the host and he asked me could I sweep it and he later texted the next day if I wanted the cleaning lady to come and clean, I said yes, so she came 2 hours later interrupting my kids test to clean. The Sunday before checkout was so loud and nosiy coming from apartment 3 I had to call the host and report it, the host told me I’ll call him and see what’s going on I know him, it was the whole day that he made some loud stomping and hitting it sounded like lighting, the host texted me saying he has a new cat that was knocking down the plants me he was chasing it, which I believe is a lie. The host thought it was a joke, I was very pissed off because it was Mother’s Day and my wife day off from work and she couldn’t enjoy it, this is totally unacceptable, I would never get this place again nor recommend it to anyone."

The quickest way of transport to Manhattan is the subway... a very short and handy 3 block walk to the closest station.

Ashley and her partner were so nice and friendly, nothing was a problem for them, super easy-going people. They made sure I felt comfortable and helped me with anything I needed. They even bought a large mirror for my room during the stay after Ashley noticed I was running to the bathroom to check out one outfit. 
Location of the place is great, 3 mins walk to subway line C which basically connects you with everything you want to see in Manhattan. Location convenience exceeded my expectations. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. 
Overall I’m very happy I stayed with Ashley and will definitely stay there again next time."

It was raining upon arrival, and there was water pouring in through one of the windows, and water was pooled up on the floor and sill, and the drywall below the window was bubbled up. Melissa, the host (not owner), was responsive and pointed me to extra towels that I could use to clean up and dry out the floor. This probably wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t raining but the apartment clearly needs maintenance. The refrigerator had pooled water inside it, and the sealant was falling off the door, making it hard to open and close fully."

Some things I wanted to know when choosing where to stay. Firstly Max and Alia were really great hosts, very friendly and able to offer great local knowledge. Their apartment is an easy 2 story walk up. As a bad sleeper I wanted to know about noise and the bed. The loft bed was really comfortable, I was worried about being claustrophobic and that was never a problem. Max has set up a light that has a USB plug so you can also charge your phone. The only street noise I heard was emergency service vehicles and with earplugs that wasn't a problem. They have a great heater in the room and I was never cold. 
The location is great! You're out of the hustle and bustle of downtown and just 2 blocks walk to a subway station. There are cafes and several supermarkets close by as well. You can walk to Central Park or Morningside Park. 
As a female solo traveler using AirBNB for the first time I felt really safe (there's a lock on the bedroom door, although I never felt the need to use it)."

Manhattan is minutes away by the subway and you’re quickly anywhere you wanna go in Brooklyn. The room and the bathroom are in perfect condition and super clean! You can use the kitchen and the hosts do their very best to accommodate you as good as possible. We will definitely visit them again. We honestly never had a better experience with AirBnB and we’ve really seen a lot. If you want to spend qualitative time in NY without worrying about your place to stay, go to Barbara and Casey. They are two of a kind."

They are both accessible though cognizant of maintaining their social distance. They provided me with a welcome package survival kit of snacks. In the current lockdown things like that matter a lot.

The space itself is sparkling clean and has a nice layout. The reading nook made for great nights of catching up on my favorite books. The weather has been decent so I’ve taken advantage of the beautiful outdoor space right in the backyard. The garden is so tranquil you won’t even realize you are in a big city. 

This has been my favorite stay utilizing airbnb. I would definitely recommend reserving staying with Eric and Dinah."

He has his photoshootings going on and loud music was playing, I was out or busy doing stuff on my lap top and was listening to my own music, I didn't mind but others might do. The neighbours were very loud until 5 am but again I personally didn't mind but some people would be annoyed by that, especially when they have to get up for work the next day.

I was reading the other review where someone said he felt unsave and didn't like the apartment, well it's Harlem and the neighbours know each other, the apartment door wasn't locked all the time. 
I personally felt save and very comfortable there, neighbours were nice and helpful and I would book Ricardos apartment again."

Unfortunately due to the pandemic, my stay was shortened and I left early which was communicated. They were understanding about the departure, appreciated my staying and invited me to come back again.

The cleaning lady was rude, malicious and doesn't even clean. I witnessed someone stay there and when they left, she didn't change the bed sheets or the towel. She invaded my personal space and touched my belongings. She saw my boyfriend arrive to take me to work and she told the owner I had overnight guest when she clearly knew I didn't which she then requested that I pay $80 for (which I refuse to pay). She saw me lock my bedroom door and as I'm leaving for work, she tried to break into it. I felt uncomfortable everytime I had to leave the room. There was a bathroom mat extremely soaked that was left there from the previous visitors and the bed sheets didn't even fit the bed. Don't even get me started on the noisy pigeons and consistent  trucks outside the window everyday. My stay was less than acceptable. I would not be booking a stay at any of her rooms EVER AGAIN!! I also don't believe I should have to lose my hard earned money on an uncomfortable, below standard place."

His location was convenient and we had no issues getting places in the city like Times Square or Central Park. Very comfortable stay- highly recommend!"
"2835","15114550","621333578",2020-03-30,298427343,"Julian","Me and two other co-workers of mine lived here for 2 months before we abruptly had to end our stay due to COVID-19. 

Alex's place was everything we could ask for. It was spacious, clean, and cozy. You could definitely tell that Alex took great care of the place. 

The bedrooms are very spacious and face east, so by 10.a.m the rooms are filled with sunlight (which is great for morning people). The beds are a little noisy, so if you move around a lot in your sleep like me be prepared for that. The bedrooms also equipped with closets and drawers to put your stuff in (I had three suitcases worth of things and they all fit nicely).

The bathroom is clean, and the water pressure in the shower is nice

The kitchen is also clean, and is equipped with your standard cooking utensils (which are clean). Make sure to turn on both vents before cooking or else you will trigger the fire alarm.

The living/dining room is equipped with a sofa that turns into a bed, a work station, and a TV that's equipped with Netflix. Perfect place to relax and chill after a long day of work/ being out.

Finally, the location is PERFECT. Where do I start? 
- You're a 7 minute walk away from the A/C line which will get you to Manhattan in 20 minutes
- There are a ton of food places nearby (I recommend Zabka Coffee, The Pattie Hut, and Corner Grind)
- There are delis on every block
- There's even a bar down the street that's a great place to hangout with your travel buddies (Shout out to Corners).
- I think most of all, my favorite part about this neighborhood is the people. Everyone we've met in Bed-Stuy is friendly and are good people. It really feels like you're a part of the community here.

Overall, our stay with Alex was great. Anyone who is going to stay at this place is very, very lucky. Thank you Alex for hosting us!"

She provides thoughtful little touches such as snacks, body/beauty products, and masks and gloves during this pandemic. Yes, it is true that the location is in a basement and that the shower is in a boiler room separate from the toilet and sink. It is also true that the room is quiet small and that it is not the most aesthetically pleasing. However, this is the best value you will get. Comparing the overall cost (all fees included), it is way less then any other Airbnb or motel around the area.  Miss Dy cares about the community because she could’ve easily charged more since local Airbnb’s around jfk are not quite cheap. She definitely tries to make people feel welcomed and you can tell it’s genuine. Thank you again to Miss Dy and her husband!"

It was between Ken’s apartment and another, closer to our child’s school but with fewer amenities. We opted for Ken’s place because it has laundry and THANK OUR STARS. We ended up being marooned here during covid, as shutdown orders went into place and our own renovation ground to a halt. We couldn’t have picked a better place if we had known what was going to happen.

We have been in the apartment all day every for about 2 months, and Ken has been unfailingly hospitable. We have a the backyard and grill, which are a godsend, and laundry. We are very safe and comfortable and self-sufficient. It would be an amazing apartment aside from the shutdown, obviously, but this situation put it to every test and it came up aces. Extremely grateful. 

For visitors to NYC, the location is fantastic, nice neighborhood (and neighbors), walkable to everything. NYC looks forward to having visitors again!"

She treated me as an uncaring apartment manager would, was not honest about telling me the apartment smelled like smoke and marijuana before I checked in. She never appeared in person to address issues. She sent a super who did not know what was going on. So I was in the difficult position of being stuck in an apartment that smelled like smoke and paint fumes with my three year old during a pandemic. She did not adjust my check out date when the apartment did not work and never acknowledged her dishonesty of letting me check into the space in the first place without warning that it smelled like smoke. This is not what I expect or have experienced with Airbnb before. Typically hosts have been actual hosts, people who are hosting you in an experience in their home that they care about. I am disappointed in Airbnb for allowing her to continue to ""host""  and for the poor experience I had that I might expect from a cheap hotel, not Airbnb."

If you are looking for that human touch plus privacy with your family Kartika’s home fits your needs.  She is accessible and easy to talk to because she’s true and respectful.  Are rarity in this world and especially in this era!"

No we didn't stay at Sam's though we would have liked to. Sam has been an excellent communicator and despite his stringent no refund policy has provided some accommodation there in light of the situation. Airbnb hasn't been a good communicator, they took 10 days to respond to my messages. They, eventually after many back and forth messages finally refunded my ""service fees.""

Overall, really looking forward to staying at Sam's place in the future, under better times..."

The house s a short block from the NYC Subway and the streeet it's on is a commercial area with many take lout food places, a Subway, Dunkin & Starbucks nearby. There is a Target two blocks away and a number of places you can buy pre made food 7 groceries as needed. There are pharmacies CVS, Walgreens nearby. In this time of confinement you can fill all your living needs quite easily  to live. The rm's are not large but the queen bed is comfortable & there is plenty of room for you belongings. The wi-fi is excellent but no TV but I am using SLING which fills my needs. The house is cleaned 3 X's a week (disinfected with Lysol) & the kitchen & bathrooms are kept clean. Mr. Lei has place both masks & Purel on a table at the entrance.  Very nice kitchen which most people don't use. Mr Lei is a great host returns TXT's quickly and can be called if need be. The NYC subway runs outside the back of the house but no one seems to be bothered. At night the trains seem to run at a low speed and make no noise at all.  The room charge is very reasonable. Highly recommended."

The apartment is pretty much everything you would expect for a short stay in the city. They have shower gel shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom and the bedroom bed was very comfortable. You do hear some neighbors that have children in the morning time but it’s typical for New York City lifestyle to hear some people talking and feel the train shake the building somewhat. Overall I recommend this place to anyone who likes to be on the run and just wants a place to come crash two at night that’s comfortable and cozy at the same time. So all the negative reviews about the cleanliness they must have OCD because the place was very clean. There are signs of wear to the apartment but you can tell that those are stains that come from normal wear and tear but it was definitely clean and sanitary. Thanks Mary for your hospitality"

I received a message from airbnb support --who did a great job remediating the situation and providing a refund-- the evening prior stating Jean had suggested a checkout time, but that AirBnB required my written consent for the checkout to proceed. As I did not see this message until late the next day (after being kicked out), I did not know of or permit the checkout, in writing or in person. Jean broke Airbnb policy by kicking me out of his AirBnB referencing a checkout time he could not enforce, giving me no time to leave, and threatening to lock me out if I went to the walgreens down the street to grab garbage bags to assist with cleaning the room.  He immediately threatened to call the cops--an idea I permitted since I did nothing wrong. While the cops escorted me out, I was told no report was filed, as I obviously did not commit trespassing. 
At one point Jean suggested I may have allowed someone into the Airbnb -- I did not--this was a lie.
There were also what appeared to holes in the bedsheets. The heating system didn't work my first 2 nights there (I only stayed for four nights). 
Do not stay with Jean. I wouldn't be surprised if Jeans review of me as a guest is less reality-based than my review of Jean as a host."

The linens in the bathroom as well as the towels provided were stained and look unclean. I did purchase my own mattress cover and sheets just for my own piece of mind. The studio is conveniently located to everything you need but keep in mind it is right off the street so you hear everything. The walls must be thin because I heard so much from
the tenants on above me and aside me. I actually had to write a note and left it outside the upstairs tenants to be mindful of their neighbors when it comes to noise. It was easy for me to stay in contact with the owners so that was good."

I love the fact that they have a shoe rack right outside the door, as we do not allow shoes in our own home. You will have plenty of hangers. The cabinets were the fullest cabinets we ever had for any AirBNB stay. There are also plenty interesting books to read.

There are no dressers in either bedroom so clothes storage is limited - one bedroom had a plastic cabinet that you could remove from the closet and place in the room, as you won't be able to open the drawer in the closet. 

Please note there is only one tv, and it is not a smart tv or connected to cable.  The toilet is also small and very close to the wall so you will need to sit sideways to use it."

The location is a 5 minute walk to Utica Ave Station, which will get you to Manhattan in 25 minutes (via 3/4 trains). 15 minutes away is Atlantic Ave, a large shopping district in Brooklyn. Crown Heights itself is filled with diversity and plenty of delicious places to eat as well. And there is a small park 2 minutes away to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. And the much larger Prospect Park is a few stops away via the 3 train.

The apartment itself is a 2nd story walkup, decently sized, and comes with all the amenities one might expect during the stay. Due to coronavirus and working from home, I spent over a month in here without leaving the apartment, and didn't feel cramped. Wifi is plenty fast which was very important to me. My only recommendation is to get a bigger TV in the living room.

Maureen is an excellent host. She would check in to see how things were going on a monthly basis. She even offered to deliver me supplies in the middle of the epidemic! I also needed to extend my stay by a few days, to which she graciously accepted. Very accommodating.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would recommend staying here. Thanks Maureen!"

The location was good, only a few minutes walk to the nearest subway. With only one transfer you can reach Times Square and Wall street. It was a strange time to be in New York due to the Corona virus but the apartment felt like a save spot. Kev came by for a chat to ask if everything was okay, he directly checked if we could stat longer when we found out that our flight got canceled. 

One negative aspect;  the walls are super thin. You can easily hear your neighbors. The first couple of days we heard almost nothing but the next guest where a little bit more loud. To us it was not a problem because each day, when we got home from the city, we felt super tired because the city is amazing!!!

A little small and very cosy. However I would not recommend it to light sleepers as the street noise is loud even with the window closed.  There were a lot of sirens (probably due to the police station near by), and an above-grove ground train just across the street over a pretty big intersection. It also didn'thelp that the courtain didn't have a blackout option.

As a healthcare worker cureently in NYC for a short term COVID contract, this place is so close to the hospital I work at, 6 mins drive. There is public transportation nearby as well but I haven't tried that yet. Jamins place was sparkling clean upon check in. He is a good communicator, reasonable and very caring; given the situation in NYC right now he checks up on me periodically. Jamin was kind enough to provide an additional healthcare worker discount, I am truly blessed to have found his place. I definately recommend him as a host! 5 stars for sure!✋"

The host was very accommodating and constantly made sure I had clean sheets and towels available. While I didn’t get to enjoy all that the neighborhood has to offer while I was staying here, I did like the fact that the stay is located to a nice number of restaurants and a subway station. I highly recommend staying here for anyone looking for a room in this part of NYC. I’m not sure you’ll find anything nicer, cleaner, or with as wonderful a host at this price.

Actually, the pictures are lacking to show the great view of the Empire State Building which was amazing - night and day! It was obvious that Shachi is into design. The apartment is close to nice cafés, supermarkets, a park and the metro (30 min to Manhattan). Shachi was very nice and caring. I recommand this place for a longer stay - especially if you are looking for a friendship with your roommate. I had to leave earlier than planned and Shachi was very accomodating. One fact a guest might want to know: The guestroom is the bedroom (with a door to close), while Shachi lives in her living room (with a folding screen to separate it from the kitchen, but no door to close), which is, howver, not at all an issue. I am planning to come back in a few months!"

I was fortunate enough to have such a clean and nice place for a month stay. Katerina’s place is the cleanest one I had ever had at any Airbnb so far. Truly sparkling clean. 

It is very close to Highland park, where I went for a run once a couple days. It is also very close the Fresh & Save supermarket, where you could find every thing else you need, besides those that have been provided by Katerina. There is a laundromat at Cypress street by Decatur, where offer great price for daily laundry (1 dollar for wash and a quarter for 10 mins dry)."

Each time I was headed back to NYC, I'd spend days looking over the options to see if anything superior had popped up but always ended up back here. There are a lot of fantastic places but no other listing combines it all in one spot at a surprisingly affordable rate. #1 It has a metro stop quite close by - the red 1 line. #2 It's as safe as you can get for NYC. #3 A full-sized washer and dryer! #4 Parking for a reasonable fee right outside your front door available from host. #4 Amazon Fresh grocery delivers here. #5 Quiet #6 Friendly, responsive hosts who respect your space #7 Clean. Where are my NYC rats and roaches? Not here. A short drive or metro/bus ride and you can keep busy with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Gardens, and a tour of Yankee Stadium. Something for everyone. Thirty or so minutes to Times Square (straight shot on the 1 line) or Central Park on the metro. Leave your car at home in your reserved parking space. Easy! Zero complaints in my four stays here. It's a freestanding home (you're in the separate basement apartment) and the owner of the home is the soul of consideration. This is one classy operation!"

"3099","16441356","619871263",2020-03-19,35146011,"Sara","So let me start from the beginning. I didn’t know, what would expect me, since I haven’t been sure, if this would be a scam, as the price was so good. Ron & Nicole kept in touch with me, which made me have a good feeling. And let me tell you this: my day of arrival was only one day before NYC shut down almost everything, cause of the corona virus and even though, they didn’t cancel the booking. I appreciate that a lot. 
As I entered the apt my jaw dropped. Such an amazing place. It is exactly as shown on the pictures. These people have great taste and know how to make their home feel cozy: modern equipment, stylish and comfy furniture. 
The smart home devices make so much fun. Due to the social distance, I had at least some conversations with Alexa. 
The living room is super big, the couch is so comfortable, that it was a pleasure to come „home“. 
The mattress felt like heaven and even the bedroom contains a smart TV, which I enjoyed a lot. 
The area is so cool. Shops and restaurants were closed during my stay, but it was still so exciting to walk through those almost empty streets. In other circumstances, you’d have a lot of cool stores and thrift shops around. Best place for vintage and street wear lovers. There are many shops close by and it’s very well connected. The day I arrived, I walked the Williamsburg bridge, which was pretty cool. 
Overall I can truly say, that this was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had by far! And I already had really nice accommodations, only that I’m too lazy to write reviews. In this case, it deserves the effort. I can honestly recommend this place, you won’t regret it. I already miss that place.
Thank you Nicole & Ron for letting me stay in your beautiful home, hope I can come back again one day :)"

"3121","16545876","617992294",2020-03-14,331814591,"Ramasubbu","I stayed for 2 weeks here. 

1)  Host - This place is taken care of mostly by Valentina's sister Maria. Check in was a breeze. She was always a text message away if you wanted to contact her. In my whole stay I would've seen her like 4-5 times at max. She was always there to help. All in all, a wonderful host. 

2) Location - The place is 30 mins away from JFK and should cost you anywhere between 35$ - 40$ to get there via cab (don't book an Uber, use the yellow cab outside). It is around 50 mins from Newark Liberty International. It cost me 115$ to get there. The place is in a very good locality. Silent during nights to get a good night's sleep. It is primarily dominated by Greek restaurants but there's plenty of other cuisines as well. The subway is literally 5 mins walk from the place and since it is the origin station, the trains are almost always empty. The ride to Manhattan takes 20 mins via the N train/W train. There's a pharmacy and plenty of grocery stores as well. Never felt unsafe even for a second. 

3) The Room - It is exactly as seen and described. The bed is cozy, the wardrobe has plenty of place for a month's storage, the desk was very useful and filled with magazines to help you explore NY. Also included were earphone covers and earplugs. There's a small TV with complimentary Netflix and other streaming services. The sheets and towels were clean. There's a mini fridge and a stand light which'll be useful if you like to read on your bed. The door is secured by a number pad lock whose number will be disclosed to you (And written on the handle). There's a mini dust bin and a small digital weighing machine. 

4) The Hall & Kitchen - Again, exactly as seen in the pics. The hall was clean and the kitchen was very well kept. I'm not much of a cook. I only used the kitchen to get water and in my whole stay I used the kitchen once. The shelves were stacked with items so I don't think you'll have a problem with anything being deficit. The couch is comfortable if you want to take a quick nap too!

5) Bathroom - It was a hygienic and clean restroom. There's a bathtub and utilities (shampoo, earbuds etc) stacked so you're covered even if you forget to get any of em. Both hot and cold water run at any time of the day. The bin in the bathroom was regularly emptied. 

Some areas where I believe there were room for improvements - 

1) The central heating in the room had some issues but it was kind of solved within a day. It also made noises when active (the earplugs helped). If you are visiting during summer this shouldn't be a hindrance. 
2) There's a big pipe running in the toilet close to the wall in the middle that is incredibly hot in the morning (in case you accidentally touch it). 
3) The plug sockets in the place were pretty difficult to use as they were old. 
4) The apartment is located in the 5th floor (Top most). So you if you have heavy baggage it'll be difficult to carry. But, this also results in good views of the city from the room's window. 

However, none of these were deal breakers.

This was literally my first time in the USA and first time using AirBnB. I couldn't have asked for a better host or gotten a better place to stay in. Even as a first timer I felt comfortable and safe and the whole stay was a breeze. 9/10 would recommend."

Drive is about 25 min in the morning and night (not much traffic at 4 am and 7 pm). Space is very comfortable and you have your own bathroom. Parking is free on the street wherever you find it, had no issues most of the time finding a spot! The only thing really missing was the overhead hood for the stove didn’t seem to want to work. You have your own thermostat so you can adjust the temperature to your liking, which was wonderful. I did notice a loud clicking noise when the heat would turn on at night and from what I read in another review it’s just older pipes warming up. I kept the temperature much lower at night to avoid hearing the pipes and would just turn it back on during the day for warmth. The space was very comfortable with extra blankets and special touches. I never got to meet the host but she truly seemed like a nice host over text. I enjoyed my stay while I was there!"
"3146","16619241","628279951",2020-06-07,101652195,"Emily","It goes without saying that Roseann and her family gave me and my dog the best Airbnb experience that I’ve ever had, and all during a pandemic! They opened their home to me as a travel nurse during the COVID19 outbreak, in the epicenter of the crisis, without even thinking twice. They treated me like family, and gave me as much or as little privacy as I wanted. Their daughter walked my dog for me while I was working my 12 hour shifts, and my dog become best friends with their dog Nala. So if you’re traveling with a dog, this is an amazing set up because they are plenty of opportunities for puppy play dates. And they now have an enclosed backyard! The space has everything you need and more for either a short or prolonged stay. I was there for 8 weeks, and couldn’t have felt more at home. If my job allowed, I would stay there forever! Very clean, super comfy bed, stylish and cozy sofa and chairs, and great and efficient use of the space to make the studio feel like home. I plan on coming back and staying at Roseann’s place in the future, and cannot recommend her stay enough. If you want complete privacy, that’s totally doable with the setup, or if you want to have meals/drinks/movie nights with the family, then they welcome you with open arms and make you feel right at home. The neighborhood is extremely safe, and I never once felt uncomfortable walking my dog at like 11pm. Plenty of parking on the street, and very quiet and cute neighborhood. I have been living at Airbnb’s for the last few years for my work, and hands down, this was my favorite stay because of the amazing studio and also the awesome family :)"

家は広く､NataliaとGustavoはとても親切でしたが､家が清潔ではありませんでした｡

私が滞在してすぐ家族は旅行で2週間留守にしました｡その後､私は猫と犬と生活を共にしましたが､至る所に糞と尿をするのでとても不快でした｡毎日ｸﾘｰﾆﾝｸﾞには来てくれましたがそれでも匂いが酷かったです｡

The place is super clean and it is close to excellent markets and restaurants. It’s also close to public transportation. The hospitality I received was unmatched by any previous stay I had at other locations. Amy constantly checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted. She even let me borrow some vinyl records when she heard I made music and brought my turntable with me. I would definitely choose this place again in the future!"

1.one small fridge for the entire population of the 9 rooms.
2. Only one bathroom and a toilet room that has NO SINK, no windows or ventilation, which is dangerous & reckless. 
3.Second floor has 4 rooms and the wifi is incredibly slow and drops all the time!!!! So you will need to sit on the stairs in order to get strong wifi signal. 
4. Most of the 9 room population are non airbnb customers. The one next to my room will go out and about bringing men she just met to her room. Walls are super thin and I hear everything, I reported everything to the host with proof but ofcorse the host kept lying to me cuz obviously he doesn't have much power over cash customers.  So instead the host shifted the blame to me accusing me of smoking weed inside the house while the host knows very well that the gentleman in the basement is a 24 hours WEED SMOKER but ofcorsehe is also a cash customer who is still at the house literally smoking a joint while i was checking out. 
Bottom line if you are ok with drug addicts and cheap hookups then this your stay"

The room has a skylight but no windows (it got a little hot). The bathroom was clean and the shower was pretty nice. I think the price was fair.

It's a short walk away from the subway that can get you anywhere you need to go. You need to be okay with hauling your luggage up some stairs, so those with disabilities or who may need help may need to look elsewhere. The bed was very comfy and the place was very clean, and it was surprisingly quiet at night. The only thing I'd say is that when people are walking around in the house above you or up and down the stairs, it can be quite noisy, but I think that comes with an older building so I didn't mind. I would stay here again if I could."

But when I found Julian's place, I didnt hesitate to go ahead and reserve immediately. The reviews, the pictures and details of the house were perfect for us - and I was wondering, how one host has all those positive reviews on Airbnb? :) but when we arrived and stayed at the apt, we knew why! Julian and Sonal are AWESOME. They are super friendly and made sure we are home away from home. Gave us tips on getting around, finding the best deals and a lovely check-in gift. Other than the friendly get-togethers and fun-chats at their lovely garden/backyard. 

We also stayed during a stressful time (after couple of days from check-in the entire NY State has been on a shut-down due to COVID-19). Yet the hosts made sure to reach out to us on a daily basis, made sure we are safe, and also offered help with supplies, getting around..etc. Not to mention, when my car got towed - Julian took the risk to get out of his quarantine and drove me to NYPD to help out with getting my car back. 

Being a foreigner and staying with this lovely family made the trip an entire different experience. Julian and Sonal travel a lot - you would be lucky if they are there during your stay. The house has its own entrance and has a private hallway, you get 100% privacy. They just live on the second floor. 

The house was super clean, has all amenities. We cooked everyday at the house, and honestly we needed nothing to bring in. Everything was there! Had extra sheets, towels, duvets, and everything you need for a comfortable stay. 

The best part, they were super responsive and always there for us!

In short, we will never forget this trip. Thank you Julian and Sonal for everything. We can't wait to be back and spend more time in Brooklyn, and with you guys! Love to you both and your lovely princess! :)"

The towels smelled like they were not washed properly.   I saw a black rodent run across the toilet.  I found red hair in the shower drain every day and the host never cleaned.

Absolutely amazing place. The space itself is stylish and comfortable; the appliances are all new and up to date. The location is great: parking is easy (just be mindful of street cleaning), the bus is literally outside their door, the train is a short walk away, and the grocery store is just down the street (but bring your own bags so you don't get charged for one - Cat thoughtfully provides some). And the area is safe; I traveled alone and ran around the neighborhood a few times and never felt uncomfortable. 

The cherry on top during my stay was the hospitality that Cat and her partner provided.  I cannot say enough great things about them; they truly made me feel like family during my stay.  Cat was very responsive to my texts, in fact she was even proactive with regard to street cleaning and keeping me up to date on any changes there.

The number provided for any concerns/questions is an invalid number and she didn't even answer the emergency contact! The instructions to enter get the key and enter in the house were very unclear. We had to ask a local for help because she told us the wrong information. The room is MUCH smaller than in pictures and you have to walk up and down these very wobbly and winding stairs just to go to the bathroom. Don't bother bringing a big suitcase or bag because it won't fit on the stairs and you won't be able to hold it without tripping. The apartment is also located in a sketchy area and me and my friend felt very unsafe. Don't recommend this place at all."

We didn’t initially get the apartment in the listing, it was only after I asked that we were moved to a more suitable apartment, still not exactly like the photos in the listing. This is a very large complex with many apartments, the building has absolutely no soundproofing. We could hear the neighbors upstairs day and night, and the walls in the actual apartment itself are paper thin, very little privacy if that’s an issue for you. The walls were scratched and dirty, the furniture is modular and not in great condition and there were decorative items missing from the walls, only a nail where something may have hung at one time. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a chance to visit the gym or pool area of the building because our stay was during the lockdown and they were closed. 
I can confirm that the apartment building is conveniently located on the East side and has access to the new Q line directly in front. However, I would not stay here again."

Refused to offer a solution, which was surprising cause previous hosts were always understanding or gave me a reasonable solution. He also asks to leave things clean in the kitchen but he doesn't check if they're actually clean. Upon my arrival, kitchen utensils were nasty. Also, lots of cockroaches by the door. My stay was 11 days and only left one toilet paper roll for me. There are no kitchen washcloths. Extremely noisy all day. It was almost impossible to sleep because they have the washing machine working all day long (which is right in front of the apartment's door). Finally, he takes forever to answer messages. His wifi didn't work for a day, I asked him about it and he never replied. I ran out of data on my plan because of it and had no way to communicate in the middle of an emergency. If I had had better treatment I would've considered to stay again in this place as the area itself is lovely."

The apartment is in a fantastic location, only about a ten minute walk from Broadway theaters and Times Square, which was amazing. Getting around was very easy, and Dan and Danny left us a nice list of good places to eat, and things to do around town, as well as other helpful tips in order to make the most of our time. The apartment itself was beautiful, with an incredibly comfortable bed, and the building was quiet. Shower was really nice as well! Abdul, the driver, also brought us to the apartment from the airport upon our initial landing in New York, and was nice enough to help us carry our bags up the stairs. Unfortunately, we came to New York just before the Coronavirus became a larger issue and sheltering in place was advised, and because of this, had to leave early and cut our trip short. They were incredibly understanding, and Dan made sure we got a refund for the days we weren’t there, and also made sure Abdul could pick us up and take us back to the airport."

I stayed with her for approx. 5 weeks while being in the city for work and had a nice walk to Columbia everyday. The room has everything you need, looking out onto a nice old church and a playground, giving the room good light despite facing north. Laundromat and shops are nearby and Karen gives you good tipps for the neighbourhood. Karen herself was very helpful upon my arrival, is nice to talk to, but also gives you your space. When I decided to cut my stay short, she was very understanding. I hope she is doing well despite the present situation in the city. In general, I highly recommend staying with her when you come to New York City."

Leslie was very attentive to our comfort and was always available for questions.

Very good coffee shop , jamaican restaurant, and best fried chicken in New York just blocks away.  Quiet at night, and patio with garden is a major bonus...couple of noisy pipes for the hot water, but you get used to it quickly.  Great kitchen for cooking as well."

As a frontline nurse I needed a place to stay that offered a respite from my long stressful days. This place was perfect for that purpose. The private patio is the only one of its kind in this area and is very tranquil. I felt very much at home in this place. The host was able to accommodate my storage needs and remained accessible during my long stay. I would happily return to this Airbnb in the future. 

As others mentioned, certain things to note are: it is a 4 floor walk-up, the pipes are randomly very noisy and although this is a great location for quick access to the subway, I wouldn’t walk around the neighborhood by myself during late hours."

There were plenty of local business and hot spots down the block from the lovely condo. It was a very kid friendly house very safe for my little wondering 7 month baby boy!

Check In was smooth and the apartment is as described,  3 double bedrooms (one is significantly larger than the other two) and 1.5 bathrooms. Not many apartments I saw when browsing boasted a sizable living space but Peggy's apartment certainly dones. 

The small price for all the above is the flat is on the 3rd floor (no lift). Perhaps you could see it as mandatory exercise if like me, you overindulged in the local cuisine.

The group enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again whenever we return to NYC."

Mark, the host, is more than accommodating and willing to trouble shoot issues on the fly. He was quick to respond to any questions that I had and since my stay was so long he messaged me every once in a while to check in and see if there was anything I needed. I worked nights and even though there were other people staying in other parts of the house I never had any issues getting sleep. It also is in an incredible location with a wonderful view and quick access to groceries, shops and the ferry.

The space is gorgeous, really well designed and thought out and so comfortable. As it was during the beginning of the Coronavirus outbreak in NYC we spent a lot of time inside working from home and I can say that this apartment is super quite. Upstairs is owned by a small production company and they used the space 3 times during our entire stay (and they’re lovely people). The area is fun, vibrant, safe and friendly. One of our favourite memories was sitting on the stoop during a warm spring evening sharing a beer and watching life happen in Brooklyn. Great times and great hosts!"

"3389","17493275","621444904",2020-03-31,79129424,"Mark","The place is really well laid out and was very thoughtfully furnished. It gets tons of natural light. Incredibly clean. It is on the second floor which comes with it's own advantages and challenges. As there's no elevator it's incredibly convenient and easy to get to your apartment with only one flight of stairs. The drawback is the bedroom is somewhat close to street level and at times the street can be a bit noisy with loud neighbors conversing outside.

Love the mini-office that is in this place. I spent a lot of time inside the apartment because NYC was under social distancing while I was here and honestly this place felt like a sanctuary where I could accomplish everything I needed. I could workout in the open kitchen area, I could do office work in the mini-office, and the couch was SUPER comfortable and I could play video games forever there. The wi-fi kept up with my online video games. The bathtub experience felt clean, and relaxing. T

The neighborhood felt very safe, and John was incredibly available via text or phone if I needed advice or had a question. The Key Food grocery store was honestly the best Key Foods I've ever been to, and I've been to at least 6 in NYC. It had everything I needed and was in walking distance. There's a more upscale grocery store in the neighborhood that John mentions in his guidebook but I didn't even need to go there because I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of Key Food. I know grocery stores aren't the usual attraction at airbnb but when it's the only trip you're making outside during an NY shutdown it's nice to know they're going to be high quality. 

Would stay here again, or recommend if a friend needed to stay somewhere in the neighborhood."

"3399","17515391","625129934",2020-05-17,100660716,"Elizabeth","Sharon & Dave hosted me for a long term stay and I have to say they are absolutely spectacular hosts. Not only are they very quick to respond to any questions or minor inconveniences, they were genuinely lovely, friendly people. 

They were absolutely respectful of my privacy, pleasant and easy to interact with, and even offered to accomodate me with the thermostat (it controls both units). 

Not only is the neighborhood lovely (very safe) but there's tons of stuff nearby and even a subway station at the end of the street so public transport is a breeze. The building is a historic brownstone (which I didn't know was a big deal, but if you're into that sort of thing...) and there are 3 locked doors between you and the street (again, it's a very safe neighborhood but at the time as my first night in Brooklyn *I* didn't know that). 

Check-in was a breeze with a realtor's lock and a detailed email including photos from Sharon a few days prior. Sharon included local tips in her email as well as in a binder in the apartment but even went so far as to call local dry cleaners for me to ask who was still doing drop off! Sheets are lovely soft & pristine white, there were plenty of pillows and the bed is great! Kitchen included dishes, silverware, pots and pans, easily enough utensils to cook with and Sharon left plenty of little things for me including toiletries, even a sleep mask and ear plugs.

I cannot recommend them enough. The space is lovely, the neighborhood is charming, the people are spectacular.

If you're looking to take transit, it is very close to the bus stop and there was a local convenience store that helped us if we needed water or snacks. Since it was my first time staying in NY, getting from the house to Times Square was bit of a far travel but it wasn't an issue for us. Definitely would stay here again!"

There is a deli a few steps away that is open 24/7 and a Laundromat downstairs. Everything was just perfect, Blondine is lovely and replies to every concern in just minutes.

People of the house were so nice and friendly. The cleanliness of the shared space was well taken care of. Everyday the bathrooms and kitchen were tidied throughly. I love the liveliness and the diversity of the Bushwick neighborhood, which made the location perfect. Also, it was very easy to get to Manhattan or to the airport with the Subway only two blocks from our doorstep. I would recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to enjoy the city and Brooklyn to the full with a lower budget."

The flat is located only minutes away from the 7 train, which takes you directly to Manhatten, e.g. Grand Central. The neighborhood is clam and nice, everything you might need is just around the corner. Communication with Olivera was always easy, as was the checkin/checkout. Highly recommended Airbnb!"

Ten steps to the left and around the corner is a post card view of the Parachute Jump, which is steps from the famous board walk.  All of Coney Island's famous icons are walking distance, as well as public transportation.  
Mr. Cosme and his wife were the best hosts! They are community members and share their wealth of knowledge of places to go and things to do. I felt safe, traveling as a single woman, because they were ""a tex"" or call away for anything.  
I was there on business for a month, but will make an effort to return for vacation and highly recommend  to anyone. Thank you!"

In wenigen Gehminuten findet man Supermärkte und Imbissmöglichkeiten, perfekt für schnelle Einkäufe. 
Die Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und liebevoll eingerichtet. Positiv ist auch, dass Vinz über der Airbnb Wohnung lebt, und direkt ansprechbar ist, falls es zu fragen kommen sollte. 
Außerdem ist die Lage ruhig, was angenehm ist, nach einem hektischen Tag in der City ruhig schlafen zu können.
Auf jeden Fall weiterzuempfehlen! :)"

Good if you're not looking for anything too special, other than proximity to the beach and restaurants. 

Melissa was a great host, very communicative throughout the process, and was accommodating with our check in. 

Regarding the noise, it definitely gets loud at night, but Melissa has two white noise machines out, and my friend and I didn't have a problem. We've also been living in NYC for years, so are quite used to loud apartments. But definitely keep noise in mind when booking."

Emch was very accommodating for my budget, and was great about checking in regularly to make sure everything was okay. The best thing about this place is the location! Very close to St Marks, and a delicious Ethiopian restaurant right across the building.  Closest subway stations are about a 5 minute walk to the west or south. Also three different hot yoga studios within 8 minute walks, and Whole Foods and Hmart are nearby. The space itself is perfect for one person. In the winter time, it can be a little dry since you can’t control the radiator, and maintaining hot water in the shower requires some fine tuning. If you are a light sleeper, I also recommend bringing comfortable earplugs. If you have a car, it seemed like there was always spots on the street, or close by (near Cooper, about a 2 min walk). If you are in NYC for a food experience, you definitely want to stay here!!"

The apartment was very clean, had nice decor, and had plenty of amenities like a coffee machine, microwave and fridge.  He responded very quickly to my questions and came to fix a light bulb that had burned out promptly.  He was also very accommodating when we had to stay and extra day and set me up in the downstairs apartment.  The location is convenient as it is like five minutes away from the airport and the highway that’ll take you into Manhattan, the Bronx or any of the other boro’s.  There is a Walgreens that is open till midnight about 3 minutes away to stock up on snacks and any supplies.  I would recommend Farhan’s place to anyone needing a place to stay while in New York."

From diverse eateries within walking distance to the 24-hour convenience store that could rival Whole Foods, directly across the street, everything I needed was at my fingertips.  I had questions prior to reserving and the host quickly responded to each one. This helpful sentiment continued throughout my reservation. 

The accommodations were clean, comfy and met every last one of my needs.  Within a hop, skip, and a jump from Manhattan, the train - which is a block or two away - was an added convenience. And did I forget to mention that STARBUCKS is located a few steps away from the front door. I mean, really, does it get any better than that? 

Honestly, this rental really felt like a home away from home!  I travel to New York often and I'd definitely stay here again."

There's 2 tvs. 1 in the smaller room and 1 in the living room. The kitchen has adequate space and is very well equipped.  Beds are comfortable. There was toilet paper in the bathroom and many towels. Living room was also  spacy and comfortable.  Because this is an older place, You can't control the temperature so the place was very cold most of the time. The place was relatively clean but the bathroom had an unpleasant smell; there was a stain on the bathroom mat where the smell was coming from. Under the bed was very  dusty so it triggered my sister's allergies a few times. The internet was very slow.
 Apart from those, overall it was a good stay.  Host was  responsive. Area was convenient with a supermarket  being 5 mins away and a deli across  tne street. Overall,  I would recommend this place."

Been living here for over a month and then this emergency popped up!  Ivanna is extremely thoughtful and helpful to us!  Been extending our stay twice already.

No joke, this happened. 
I asked him to get out, he refused. I was then scared enough to just pack up and leave immediately, but he stayed three inches from me, smiling, and being evil as he continued callng me a drug dealer. 
This was INSANE!!!

She said her room was small , but perfect in size for her. She and I are happy to give Alexander a great reference."

A limpeza não era a melhor. Muito pó debaixo da cama e até meias dos hóspedes antigos encontramos. Casas de banho não muito limpas. 
Não nos explicaram como funcionava a recolha de lixo, não há contentores na rua. A casa tem 3 ou 4 quartos e uma pilha de lixo acumulou-se na cozinha. Só 6 ou 7 dias depois alguém o removeu. 
Os outros hóspedes cozinhavam e deixavam a louça na suja na cozinha vários dias.
Deveriam ter alguém que fizesse a limpeza das áreas comuns regularmente, pelo menos dos wc’s. 
A localização era boa, apesar de não ser a morada fornecida pelo Airbnb, a mesma que colocamos no visto ESTA para entrada no país. Quando chegamos à morada fornecida contactos o co-anfitrião Nick que 15 min depois nos encontrou e nos levou para a casa que era uns metros à frente, na mesma rua. A casa era a mesma das Fotos fornecidas no site.
No dia de check out contactámos o Nick que nos deixou fazer late check out sem qualquer custo, o que nos ajudou bastante para não andar com as malas durante o dia. Anfitriões simpáticos e acessíveis.
Apesar dos problemas de limpeza, as condições do apartamento são bastante boas, espero que o meu feedback ajude o anfitrião a melhorar. Obrigada."

Place is place is better than it looks in the photos, except the backyard which could turn out pretty amazing if it had some work done. Spacious room for NY standards and price.

It is centrally located and around the corner from a prime subway station. Very clean and comfortable, and fully furnished with everything one needs making it truly feel like home. Monica was immediately responsive and did everything possible to accommodate me, offering local amenities, and make this a fantastic experience.

There is a nice size refrigerator but no microwave or toaster oven. The neighborhood is noisy, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Lilly was very welcoming and we instantly felt at home in the space. It was a tight fit for three of us, but it worked because we did not spend much time in the apartment. We enjoyed our stay at Lilly's place that was so well located we could easily explore the city and return to eat or reboot before going out again."

La ubicación es excelente cerca de todos los subtes. El dpto está en un edificio viejo que tiene acceso solo por escalera pero el dpto esta bien cuidado. La cocina es muy chiquita pero alcanza y sobra para cocinar una comida diferente y más sana que la que se puede comer en la calle. Muy cerca hay súper y eso ayuda. 
Los ruidos de la cañería de la calefacción que dicen en los otros comentarios son ciertos pero no nos incomodo en absoluto y hay que tener en cuenta el modo de construcción de New York lo que me parece que va a suceder en todos lados lo mismo.
La casa está completamente equipada con shampoo, acondicionador, crema, jabón, detergente, secador de pelo! Todo lo necesario para la higiene personal y del hogar. Es el hogar con el verdadero espíritu de Airbnb.
Buena relación calidad precio.

"3726","19001879","625121185",2020-05-17,140274093,"Alex","Well, a bazillion 5-star reviews don't lie.  We've lived all over the world and been in dozens of airbnb's by now, and one lesson we've learned is to read the reviews.  I've gotten lazy about writing them up, but I see how important a service it is for fellow travelers and, of course, the hosts.

We stayed in Evelyn's apartment for a month during the Corona pandemic in April, so we really were stuck at home for most of it, and it was an enormous luxury to have such a gigantic space.  If you're not from NYC (or Paris, London, HK, Shanghai, or other densely packed city), you might not appreciate just how big this place is compared with other apartment and hotel rooms, but in NY, this place is just vast.  It's a studio, but because it's so big, you really feel completely separated in the bedroom area, and it was easy for me to have privacy working from the bedroom or the kitchen while my wife was in the other area.  The ceilings are super high as well, and the feeling of spaciousness is fantastic.

And back garden is such a rare luxury, such a serene escape from the bustle of the city.  Beautifully planted and lush, we barbecued multiple times and felt like we were really unplugged from the city.

The apartment is just beautiful and stylish in a way that you never find in such an inexpensive airbnb. Typically you are in someone's cluttered place while they go off to their girlfriend/boyfriend/buddy's place, or a stark box of an investor super-host.  This is neither.  It's warm, welcoming, and feels like a beautiful home just for you.
Additionally, it's the best stocked apartment we've ever rented.  Multiple brands of toothpaste, sunscreen, shampoos, moisturizers, and everything you could need or want in the kitchen for a long term stay.

The neighborhood:  Probably the only negative thing I could say is that if you want to spend a lot of time in Manhattan, Greenpoint is not the most convenient neighborhood for subways because you'll have to take the G to either the L or the 7 (though you could also walk to the ferry which affords you a lovely ride, but not the fastest).  The upshot is that you're at least 10 minutes further from everything because of that double wait on the platforms.

However, if you want an authentic NYC neighborhood experience, it's hard to beat Greenpoint as a quintessential Brooklyn neighborhood.  Amazing restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, and bars with a vibrant, hip scene, and a short walk across McCarren Park to North Williamsburg (arguably the best nightlife/restaurant scene in the city right now).

And, finally, the host:  Evenlyn is just fantastic, and during out month stay, over and over again went the extra mile and inconvenienced herself without a second thought to make our special.

Would absolutely stay again on our next NY long-stay."

"3728","19007359","622859115",2020-04-21,62225,"Jo","I am a Brooklynite so I can attest that Jourdan and Holly have a gorgeous warehouse loft that is like no other space I’ve ever seen or stayed in in NYC. 
It could be called raw cozy grandeur — amazingly high ceilings, gorgeous huge windows, concrete floors,  all styled to perfection within a comfortable kitchen, living room area, and bedroom. 
The bathroom, sometimes a sad aspect of nyc apartments because of how compact everything has to be, is also lovely and well kept. 
It’s a Williamsburg paradise and an Airbnb gem, not to mention how attentive and warm the hosts are. It’s sparkling clean, unique and thoughtfully appointed. 
I truly believe you can, as I did, make this a home away from home, whether you’re there a day or a month. 
Not to mention it’s dog friendly, incredibly spacious, and has a grand piano to boot! It’s hip luxury melded with down-home comfort. 
Stay here and you will have a hard time ever finding a better place in BK!"

She cleans the house regularly, takes the trash out, replaces the toilet paper, and changes the bedsheets often.  When the quarantine started and I was confined to studying in my room for 8+ hours per day, she brought a desk lamp for me to make sure that I had enough light in my workspace.  Additionally, Yumi is friendly and makes me feel comfortable when she visits to check on me.  She is also very fast when responding to my questions and requests over text.

First, I consider myself an incredibly easy to accommodate guest. I booked this room for 20 days— after 8 days, AirBnb intervened and cancelled my stay, refunded the remainder of my trip, and offered me 9 days at a studio apartment 5 blocks away and AT NO COST TO ME to make up for my experience. That’s how bad it was!! The listed hosts on the app, Mira, Mandy, and Emily, seemed reasonable prior to my arrival, but upon arriving, I learned that none of them actually live on-site, it was actually just myself and a woman named Nadine, a long-term tenant in the apartment. Nadine was, from day 1, disgustingly awful to me for the entire extent of my trip, yelling at me through the walls, singing loudly and belching (ew!) and creating a terrible vibe in the space, she refused to socially distance, the coup de grace was she stopped my washing machine mid cycle as a power move, meaning my clothes (in a pandemic, mind you) were uncleaned, and was in fact the reason that AirBnb was forced to take action to assist me in this case. The listed hosts, for their part, were incredibly slow and uneager to respond— an attempt to reach Emily by phone took DAYS and required a ridiculous amount of hand-wringing on my part. Upon arriving at the replacement listing, I just broke open and hardcore cried for an hour over the whole experience. Below a (Hidden by Airbnb) -level arrangement, never mind an AirBnb stay. Good riddance to Nadine (why are you so hateful??) and thank you to AirBnb for getting me out of this listing. Surely the hosts will respond with some “everyone is entitled to their perspective” bs, they and their listings should be banned from the app for how I was treated. See other reviews and stay away!!"

Everyone who stayed there crossed paths at different times, so it felt like you were the only one home. Price is perfect for the condition, interior/bedding super outdated, there were holes in the fitted sheet, but I'm not picky, since they smelt clean and I slept great. Bed is extremely comfy pillowtop! Bathroom is small. Only issue, no where to put your clean stuff, other than on a towel on the floor. Bathroom caddies for each room suggested...AND for sure needs ""coat"" type hooks installed, to hang your clothing/towels, plus a new towel rack on wall (no idea why the broken one is even on the wall, since it fell off on every single person). Loved the neighborhood. Right off the Subway 3 min walk. Pizza and Mini mart on corner. 15 min drive to LGA. Beautiful homes and nature. Just look down when you walk, cuz dogs poop all over on middle of the sidewalks..."

She accommodated me at the last minute and even allowed for an early check-in so I could work through the business day without disruption. Her space is beautiful, clean, and well-kept. The massive kitchen counter was a great place to take calls, and the ample lighting mixed with dimming functionality allowed me to work late through the night on a busy day. Her kitchen is well stocked with appliances so if you’re staycationing and want to cook, you have everything you need. I loved the thoughtful touches (candles and plants), and plentiful books around the apartment. I had a chance to read one of them on the couch with plenty of sunlight pouring in one morning. She also has a separate space that I was able to use for an at-home workout. Highly recommend for a staycation if you’re looking to “travel locally” this summer."

The bed is horrible unless you are just one person and can sleep in the middle where it caves in. The heat is always really hot. The drains drain very slow. If you would happen to stay here and need to sleep during the day count that out. The noise upstairs most days is very loud and the bedroom is located under their living room.

Location
The place is located in Gowanus/Park Slope which is a really quiet and safe neighbourhood. The neighbours are extremely friendly and warm and were there to help me if Alysse wasn't around.  It is also a 2-minute walk to the nearest train station with access to multiple lines and getting around was relatively easy. Walking distance to Wholefoods and plenty of shops in Park Slope. Prospect Park is a few blocks away if you love chilling at the park with so many farmers markets happening in the nearby vicinity too. DUMBO isn't too far away as well.

Amenities
Alysse made sure that the house was super clean when I arrived and stocked up as much as she could (bear in mind that toilet paper was a rarity in supermarkets these days). She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable. I also had access to her kitchen and her spices which was super useful for someone who cooks often.

Host
Alysse is simply an amazing host. She was extremely warm and helpful, taking me on a short tour around the block to show me some of her recommendations (and her favourite bagel place which was to die for). I appreciate her hospitality and helpfulness. She takes so much pride in decorating her place and making it feel like home. Due to COVID-19, I had some issues with my flights and the delays meant I had to stay for an extra three days. Alysee assured me that I can feel free to extend my stay which provided me with so much relief.

In conclusion, I am really glad I found  Alysse and her place. My five weeks in New York was truly enjoyable despite the circumstances and I highly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you, Alysse."

The location is in the east village, with so many restaurant and bars around (obviously could not make full use of them), with different subway line roughly 10min walking. It’s safe, relatively quiet, especially in this room.

The house is clean considering it’s an old building, but Hannah does a great job cleaning everything. It’s a tiny space but comfortable for one person, especially if you’re in the room or out and about. The bed is comfy, and you have enough space for yourself.

So easily this is a 6/5 stay, because even though this was a stressful time, Hannah managed to accommodate me anyway she could. She’s polite and kind, and will give local tips anytime you want."

The apartment is nice and spacious, a great location, and with nice thoughtful touches to make it feel more like a home away from home. The ceilings were high and added to the nice spacious feeling. Has a finished basement with two additional beds and a half bath. The laundry room is shared within the building but we never had an issue using it when we wanted. It uses a pay-through-app service which we found easy to use. The kitchen has all the amenities you could need including a dishwasher which isn’t always common in the city.
The neighborhood was friendly, the corner deli about 5 steps away was hugely convenient and was one of the better quick food spots we found. There are two bigger grocery stores and a big Walgreens very close. Unfortunately we were caught up in the COVID isolation and weren’t able to explore more of the area, but from what we saw, there was plenty of necessities within a short walk.
Parking was a bit difficult, but that’s the city. Ivo and Rachel were terrific hosts and checked up on us and were very responsive to a few questions we had during our stay."

My issues were not so much with the room itself (the bed was very comfortable) but the insects and inaccurate listing. What was not specified was that this “G unit” apartment, is actually a garage. Hence why there would be ANTS and OTHER BUGS here. 
I’ve also had an issue regarding amenities. Ali specified that there were two parking spots I was able to use after a certain time, which was included in the overall price/cost for this Airbnb.  However, the cars parked in those spots during the day rarely moved. I made several attempts to contact him with this issue, as if you’re from New York you would understand parking in the flushing area is extremely difficult to find and especially after 8 pm. As a young woman, the idea of having a convenient parking space accessible to me at night was extremely important. When Ali finally replied back to me regarding the complaint, he was only apologetic but failed to enforce the rules he had specified in his Airbnb description.  
I was severely disappointed in my stay, I had other options but had chose this one because of its convenience with parking as most others did not provide that. 
*Bottom line: A “Cozy” room, but absolutely NOT worth the money."

Fully equipped kitchen made it easy to make my own meals. The walk-up did not bother me at all. Felt like I was home."

No heat. Ants were crawling everywhere. Glue mouse traps caught 7 mice. I was unable to place any garbage bags since the trash buckets were overflowing. Above the apartment on the second floor is a band who practices drums In the very early mornings. I can hear loud banging on the floor from someone having sexual activity. It was a nightmare. There were no other places I could have booked at because of Covid places are not accepting reservations. So I had to ride it out. Never again...."

Asking for heat/hot water atlease 2/3 times a day then the response to that after weeks of dealing with that from the host was ""her energy bill is going through the roof!"" My partner and I was literally shocked from that response because that has to be the most ghetto thing I've heard from someone who considers themselves to be a ""business person"". Next....the bed we slept on the mattress was sunken in the middle and box spring was broken up OMG we are still suffering from body aches n pains and we currently receive treatment from Physical therapy and Orthopedic therapy. My daughter was giving a thin cheap mattress to sleep on the floor which came from under our mattress lol! The host was supposed to provide a Air bed which she did but it was filthy w/holes in it what a joke but she didn't seem to care she got paid already! Then the smells of sewer OMG it smelled like something died in the walls. We were charged a cleaning fee but she never cleaned ANYTHING not even the 1 set a sheets, towel she gave us and NEVER changed our linings so horrible I had to get my linings out of my storage unit! 
The WORST is the MICE OMGGGG how disgusting and unsanitary. The host act as if she was unaware of this lol what a insult then got pissed when I reported to Airbnb requesting a refund for my days remaining she intentionally turned off the heat/hot water and the wi-fi our last day. But we won in the end yayyy"

As someone else wrote on a review - the sofa is not at all comfortable and I would recommend that Chris purchased another one in the future. 

Down point which is completely outside anyones control is the extensive construction outside the building that started at 7am. This would affect someone who is a light sleeper. 

Sadly me and my friend arrived during the global pandemic however the kitchen was big enough for us to cook meals. Also there is a great little bakery called Nick + Sons which I would highly recommend! 

Thank you for such an amazing stay and we will be back soon!"

I talked to Ana so that we could do something about it because I paid a month and stayed only 5 days, I suggested paying half the rent and giving me back half so I wouldn't be unfair.  She didn't even want to know about my suggestion, unfairly, without an ounce of understanding at the moment we are living. I am a student and needed solidarity at that moment.  If you have any problems after booking do not expect it to return anything, injustice! airbnb can’t do anything because it’s a matter of honesty."

El anfitrión se ha comportado de la manera más egoísta posible frente a la crisis global del Covid19. Debido a que se declaró la emergencia tanto en nuestro país como en USA y nos obligaron a volver a nuestro país de origen, el anfitrión no quería devolver el dinero.  No solo no se han solidarizado con la situación, sino que de muy mala manera nos obligó a dejar el alojamiento con un mensaje poco cordial. Gracias a la intervención de AIRBNB hemos podido recuperar el dinero, pero el anfitrión se caracterizó por falta de comprensión, solidaridad y empatía. El lugar no es recomendable, está ubicado en un sótano, con humedad y muchos ruidos. Durante la noche no se puede dormir, el anfitrión vive arriba de la vivienda y se escuchan ruidos todo el tiempo. Si puedes, busca un mejor hospedaje."

The hosts even brought food for us-very thoughtful. Only a few things made this place a 4 out of 5. The bed was comfortable but a bit tight for two people, the internet connection was slow so we had to use our phone hot spots, I’m thinking that was mostly because we were on the bottom floor of the building. Lastly, you could hear a lot of movement from the people in the upstairs property. Nonetheless, this apartment was large and beautiful and wonderfully decorated. Very close to a lot of cool stuff."

Anyone can stay in an homogenised service apartment but to experience Michael and Yas’s loft is to appreciate how so many of our influential artists, photographers and designers lived in the heart of the city from the 1950’s onwards. 

Artist’s work spaces like the loft are always adapted to make them into living spaces and Michael has done a good job. We loved being in a place so well equipped and furnished with Michael and Yas’s good taste."

I was able to work from home in a peaceful environment; while also having the luxury of spending time outside on the private balcony. Their place is fully equipped with everything you will need while staying away from home (truly a home away from home). After my work shift ended I would spend two hours walking around the neighborhood; which is lovely and peaceful also. There is a variety of restaurants available which will satisfy any choices you may have in mind to eat. There is a supermarket nearby as well. I was able to prepare my own meals there too. Everything at their place is modern and it was a comfortable space to spend the week. There should be no fear at all staying here during a pandemic or not. The place is extremely clean and private. I felt safe inside and while taking walks (exploring the neighborhood). I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a place to stay <~> to chose this one. You will not be disappointed at all.

This is without a doubt my favorite of all time! For starters, Jaime's attention to detail made what was already an excellent location (be sure to try the Peruvian Surfish on the corner, as it's excellent, and there are many, many organic markets, shops, pharmacies, etc. well within a few blocks' walk) and a sweet, charmingly decorated space even more appealing: Things like bags for shopping, nice paper napkins, food storage containers, books on New York things to do, tons of lovely lotions and everyday toiletries, extra kleenex, paper towels and TP, plenty of pots and pans and other things for cooking, multiple umbrellas, you name it -- if we needed it, it was almost always there. The couple of things I recommended (a bottle to keep water cold in the fridge, more ice cube trays) appeared on the door step the next day. Jaime is incredibly responsive (always got a message from her within minutes), and cares deeply that her tenants have an excellent experience. She connected me with an outstanding mobile laundry service, and knew where I could find pretty much anything in the neighborhood. The subway is just a few blocks away. She also supplied some basic ingredients, including herbs and spices, oatmeal, butter, snacks and an amazing locally made raspberry jam. I felt totally safe, and the neighborhood is pretty friendly in general. I stayed for two weeks -- I wish I could have stayed longer, and I'll for sure be back."

Area rich with history and a number of public spaces where you get a real flavour of the diverse community. Easy access to the rest of Brooklyn and Manhattan via subway & bus options.

The space itself was warm, stylish and roomy with a well equipped kitchen, laundry facilities, shower over bath-tub and many other creature comforts that made us feel right at home. A sunny fenced courtyard at the back of the property was also welcome and well-utilised.

Check-in & out couldn’t have been easier and Alex was quick to respond to any communications.

We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to other travellers."

If you are travelling to NY to watch some Broadway shows, this place is within short walking distance to the theaters. It's also quite close to subway stations and the more tourist-y areas of Times Square without being stuck in the middle of it. 

There are a number of food places nearby with delicious food and friendly service. Special shout out to UT47 (went there on Andrea's recommendation) on the same street and Amy's Bread just around the corner on 9th Ave. Be aware that you may be staying with other AirBnB guests, but I had no issues with those were there during my stay. There was a little noise from the apartments around but that is to be expected and was not an issue for me as I am not a light sleeper. I will say that one of my favourite things about staying at Andrea's was the bed - it was so incredibly comfortable and the doona was so cosy and warm that I didn't need to wear a bunch of layers to bed as I had been prepared to do! 

Thank you once again to Andrea for having me at her apartment! I would definitely recommend this to anyone travelling to NY and would stay there again myself :)"

Moreover, throughout the trip she makes herself available for questions ect.

The bedroom is very spacious with multiple areas to lounge around including the desk area and the loveseat. The bed is very comfortable with soft covers and pillows that you can sink into and feel like you’re sleeping on clouds. My favorite were the blackout curtains to keep the sun out in the mornings. Greatest sleep of my life!

Even though there is no kitchen available, Jake has provided a microwave, mini fridge and a coffee machine right in the room. All amenities worked great. There are multiple restaurants in the area that deliver a variety of food. There’s even a corner store right on the corner of the building that makes great food on the grill. 

The hosts were so friendly and super responsive. They answered any messages right away and even check in using the app throughout your stay to make sure you don’t need anything. No wonder they are super hosts."

The room is exactly as pictured, with clean sheets and towels, plenty of hangers in the closet, and the room has a huge window letting in a lot of sunshine (which you don't always get in NYC apartments).

I was just disappointed in Jonathan's response to how we as guests were impacted by the COVID situation. After Broadway announced going dark and all our plans for the weekend got canceled due to worsening circumstances and tighter restrictions, we responsibly decided to leave NYC early and return home. Despite AirBnB saying our trip would be eligible for a refund, Jonathan refused and then stopped communicating to us and to AirBnB representatives. Not the response I would have expected during a crisis."

Eric SOMENTE atende via mensagens do aplicativo do airbnb ! Num momento de emergência procurei ele pessoalmente e fiquei assustado com a forma agressiva em que fomos tratados, não deu atenção e enviou mensagem no app logo em seguida. Poderia ser mais humano e empático. Isso nos deixou com medo o resto dos dias."

"4218","20566445","622650052",2020-04-18,105042763,"Heather","All i can say is that i was unsatisfied with my stay, it was a completely different looking bed than in the picture, with no backboard at all,  different sheets and comforter than in the pic on the website, lumpy mattress with a big hole in the middle, sheets, comforter and pillowcases were very scratchy and the 2 pillows provided were extremely flat and lumpy. It reminded me of a college dormitory style room with very limited amenities and only a small old fashioned electric plug in heater to provide any heat. The bathroom was so tiny i was knocking the sides of the walls, it was kinda dirty too.... the bathroom sink was very tiny and was the only sink in the place, and the water was coming out cloudy.... also the fridge was a mini fridge with no real freezer, it didn't keep my food cold at all even on the highest setting. The freezer was completely iced up and no ice cubes were provided. The only seat besides the lumpy bed was a folding chair, the whole place was just so small, especially for the price compared to other places i have stayed with Airbnb. 1 star is all i can give to this place. Very dissatisfied..."

The roku was outdated and did not respond quick enough because of the weak signal between the remote and tv. No light for the walkway. Small lanterns were dying out and there was no light at the door. Overall decent stay nothing a bottle of aerosol couldn’t fix as far as the smell but there was only a fan in the heat and humidity. Not worth the price I paid."

It's a really lovely location (right next to a CitiBike station) and prospect park is walking distance. 

A note to those booking - please be aware the subway goes right beneath this apartment - I have some trauma from earthquakes and it was alarming at first, but became normal after a few days. 

Highly recommend! Great neighbors too."

The apartment felt like home almost immediately. It was clean, cozy, and had everything equipped for a long or short stay (including a washer and dryer!). The bed and couch were very comfortable. For anyone working or streaming, the internet was fast and reliable as well. The kitchen was clean, well stocked and had everything I needed to cook.
The apartment is located within walking distance to supermarkets, wine stores, coffee shops and two train limes that will take you anywhere you need to go. 

I arrived in this apartment right as NYC was told to work from home due to COVID-19. So I spent two weeks inside the apartment simply living and working. The place truly felt like home and kept me sane, and I could not recommend this place enough for anyone passing through NYC for any period of time."

"4242","20636416","619427946",2020-03-17,60175771,"Timea","We are a couple who spent ten days in Chris’s place. 

First of all, the location was very convenient: we could get to Manhattan with a small metro ride. We used the L line mainly and bought an unlimited weekly metro card for $34. We also frequently used the ferry service to Wall Street pier or to the 34th street for $2.75 per ride because we loved the view, especially at sunset time. You can get to the ferry station in couple of minutes from the flat as it is at the end of the street - go there for Manhattan views at night;-)

The Williamsburg neighborhood around the house is lovely. It’s full of great restaurants. Our top choices: Cafe Mogador Williamsburg for breakfast, Samurai Mama for udon noodle soups and ramens, Teddy’s Bar and Grill for beer, and Shelter for dinner and drinks, and there are many more. 

There is a Farmer’s market in McCarren park on Saturdays, it’s worth visiting and have a lovely chat about apples or groceries with the sellers. There is a big supermarket close to the corner of Metropolitan Avenue and 3rd street and the kitchen in the flat is comfortable to cook, so you can save on food, time to time if you choose that option. 

The loft is not new but very light, comfortable, clean and stylish and you can feel at home immediately. You will also appreciate the bed with its memory foam. There is a door next to it to the back yard so you can air the place well. The living room area has a working desk and the WiFi is super fast. The canapé was great for movie nights on Netflix, the wardrobe swallowed all our suitcases and there was plenty of place to keep our belongings in order, so it was easy to keep the loft tidy. 

Everything worked well. When we arrived one of the heating units started letting the steam out. Jan arranged the repair service promptly and the unit was changed by the time we came back from our program. It was really convenient to contact them, they live upstairs so you can run up, but we used the Airbnb app, communication went smoothly. 

We’ve received many recommendations for programs, so it’s worth contacting them with any special interest. 

Overall, we had a perfect experience. We loved the flat, the hosts, the neighborhood. Highly recommended."

She has been the person keeping my spirits high during this pandemic from her sense of humour, her food, her advice and just her general energy. I truly have enjoyed my time here so far and, as Airbnb apartments go, it is perfect for getting around and for long stays.

I cannot stress enough that this was the best move I made for 2020 and I’m blessed to have had my stay here. As a Doctor on the front lines in healthcare, this has been a haven for me and I want to personally thank Lidia for all her support and warmth. To all future people looking for a place to stay in NYC, trust me on this one, it is a rarity to find such a place and a person together. I hope you have a similar experience to me and enjoy all the convenience of the express trains nearby, Central Park, groceries, gyms and a peaceful neighbourhood. 

Amazing place!!!!!"

I was faced with unexpected circumstances and needed to check-in in the middle of the night. Literally. I only message Nick to ask without actually expecting he would agree. He did. I booked the room and one hour later I was in, at 1 am.  Nick was so incredibly friendly and kind. His wife was also a gem. I felt very welcomed and safe. Due to exigent circumstances concerning the Corona virus, we ended up having to be quarantined together. We truly became a family. I can not praise this couple and my stay enough. Thank you Nick and Sapir. 
Ps. They ended up fostering a cat. Mc. Muffin. He is the best therapy pet one can ask for."

The turntable and the excellent record collection were quite a boon as NYC was slowly closing down last week and I spent more time indoors. Access to Netflix, Prime & Hulu was also free. Though it took me some time to learn to navigate using the Xbox remote. Also, access to a 24 hr newly equipped gym and laundry facilities in the basement was a bonus.

I suggested that she and Thomas should  leave the space heater out to give people the option for more heat and to leave a broom and dustpan in case people want to clean up before they leave (also because I want to keep my Airbnber reviews positive :).  They were receptive to the suggestions which I also appreciate. Thanks again guys and stay safe!"

The living area has Netflix for you so that’s a plus. He has plenty of cleaning supplies which was great. The street is quiet so you won’t get much noise while trying to sleep except the occasional ambulance. The bed is comfortable as well.

From the complimentary bottle of wine & coffee to even ice it really was the little things that made this place feel more like home. Even with everything going on in the world it was a really nice retreat in the middle of Brooklyn. A balcony, a fully equipped kitchen, a couple of big screens, a comfy couch, & a gracious/communicative host... we couldn’t ask for more. We felt so at home we extended our stay a couple of days & Harvin made it so easy to do so."

I enjoy a home cooked meal and with most restaurants being closed I was able to prepare meals comfortably. The kitchen has great quality cookware and everything else you need. Kitchen water pressure was a little low but there is also a dishwasher. 

The balcony right off the living room is a great touch! You can socially distance and still enjoy some fresh air.

Harvin was kind, professional and extremely accommodating. I could not ask for a better host.

I cannot wait to stay again."

The home is very clean and we were very safe throughout the whole stay. She also provides many amenities that make you feel at home, like TV with many streaming platforms, extra food/oil/spices in case you need it, and coffee/tea, which was very thoughtful.

If I had to use my car ( which I did not have to do much at all) I just made sure I drove during the day and parked it before 4 pm. However, everything you need is only a few steps away. Again, it was a wonderful stay. And I hope to get back to New York soon. Ps. If you book with Tanya please give scooter and gingy a snuggle for me. Stay safe friends!"

His property is your typical NYC brownstone idyllic home. In fact, we saw two films being made in the area while we stayed there and many curious passersby tourists stopped to take a photo of Dennis' house. The location gives you a different perspective on what it means to live in Manhattan. Harlem is a picturesque area with interesting bars and restaurants and a unique sense of soul only Harlemites can provide. Although we had to leave NYC due to the novel coronavirus and stop our visit short, we had a great time and if we're back in New York, we'll definitely stay again with him. He was not only a kind, considerate, knowledgeable and attentive host, but also quite accommodating."

It clearly had not been cleaned in a long time. The kitchen area was full of old grease and crusted on food, the bathroom had mold, old toothpaste, and a toilet with dried excrement. Half of the shower floor was literally just duct tape. There was significant cobwebs and dust throughout the unit, the entire place smelled like smoke, and there was no hot water.

I will say, I do know that the renter before me did not follow their no-smoking policy. Lana herself was very responsive, and check-in was very easy. The location seems to be in a good neighborhood, and it was very quiet. I think if the unit was thoroughly cleaned, and necessary repairs made, it has the potential to be a good spot to stay. However, based on my experience, I would not recommend it."

The space is calming and peaceful and nice to come back there to regroup before heading out for new adventures. The room is a good size and has plenty of storage space. Guests have their own bathroom, which is a total bonus!!! Also close to two subway stations taking you wherever you want to go, really easy to get around once you get a feel for it. 
I felt pretty safe in the area and Jenn had good eating recommendations. Also liked that this place was close to Prospect Park, a great location for walking.  Unfortunately I had to cancel my trip and fly home due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Jenn helped me work through my options and on my last night there, she shared a small bottle of rum with me to say farewell. As I was there for research, Jenn also introduced me to a colleague who works in a similar field. I really appreciated this 'next level' hospitality. And the price - wow! Highly recommend Jenn's place, when the borders are open again."

It's a great, thoughtfully laid-out space, feels super safe and it's massive by New York standards - having stayed in a hotel room for 6 weeks beforehand, it was a joy to have this warm and cosy apartment to call home for ten days. Kendra and Julien (and their gorgeous son, Lucien) are delightful hosts, nothing is too much trouble for them and they were full of local knowledge - ask them about the best crepes in NYC! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a home-from-home experience in New York! Thanks, guys! xx"

There is lots of space in this huge 4bdr/3bth house plus extra beds in the attic. I loved the beautiful wooden stairway and wooden accents throughout the house. There is a full kitchen with a large double door refrigerator, dining and living room. There is private parking for up to 2 cars with a private driveway. There are TV’s in every room and a pool table in the game room that the kids loved the most. The entire house was spotless and very clean, all the beds were perfectly made with towels rolled on each bed for each of us and so very comfy. The subway is about a 10 minutes walk and there are local stores, restaurants, and groceries just around the corner. The host was very responsive with any questions we had and the check-in process was a breeze with the lockbox which came in very handy as we arrived very late at night. There were 10 of us and it was more than enough space for all of us to have an amazing time. I highly recommend this listing and I will definitely stay here again on our next family visit to NYC."

It was legit 5 minutes walk and Christina's house is beautiful. It is the epitome of what cleanliness is and I assure you that you will have a great time staying at her place. 10/10 recommended.

Something I really want to mention is that in the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, I had to unfortunately leave early and cancel the rest of my stay. Regardless of what AirBnB's policies were, Christina was extremely supportive and made sure I just reach home safely without thinking or worrying about the cost of my booking etc and it was tremendous. This is something very few kind hearted people do and Christina is one of them.

Take my word, stay at her place and you will not regret it once!"

No funciona la secadora de ropa. 
Nos entrego el departamento con la mayoría de las lámparas quemadas y casi sin iluminación.

Las fotos del anuncio no están actualizadas y difieren de lo qué hay adentro. 
La puerta de entrada es muy insegura y no posee pasador de seguridad interno. 
En ningún lado el anuncio indica qué hay que subir al tercer piso por escaleras.

En cuanto al lugar, si bien son cabinas independientes que te permiten cierta privacidad, la verdad tienen cero aislacion, por lo que escuchas constantemente todo lo de la pieza de al lado y cuando pasan por afuera. Por lo mismo desde las 9 tratan que nadie meta ruido, pero la verdad todo se escucha.
El cubículo es un poco más pequeño que lo que se ve en las fotos a mi parecer y el colchón bastante duro. 
Lamentablemente no tiene ningún espacio para compartir, lo cual hace llegar solo a encerrarte. 
La limpieza es buena. 
Lo recomiendo como un lugar para quedarte no más de un par de días, de ser así es aceptable."

The home is older, but they do a good job at taking care of it. The room is far bigger than most rooms that you will find, especially for the price. Its about a 5-8 minute walk from a smaller subway station where you can catch local trains into the city, and about a 10-15 minute walk from a larger station where I caught express trains into the city everyday. If you're looking to work or visit the city, my average commute to Times Square was about 45 minutes. All in all, expect creaky stairs, but a great environment.

The host was responsive to any questions or concerns I had - as an exampe, during our stay, the security system for the building got upgraded and everyone needed to get new key fobs.

With the whole city preparing for a lockdown we had to quickly find another place to stay, with a bit more room for both of us to be working and not constantly in the same space. Thankfully Sausan was very understanding and decided to give us a partial refund via Airbnb credit, that we hope to use in the nearby future!

Besides that, the studio is as shown in the pictures (maybe a little older looking now...). Although it is small, it's perfectly fine for a single person or a couple. Enough space to keep you luggage underneath the elevated bed, equipped kitchen, Netflix, etc...

It is very well located in the East Village neighborhood. Close to supermarkets, laundromats, amazing bookshop (Mast!!), and several other services. The nearby park is also a great plus, and you are 15min away from East River Park for sports or just a nice walk."

The location of this airbnb is super since it's in walking distance to restaurants, supermarkets and subway station. 

The apartment is spacious and has everything I needed. I actually have to stay here for longer than a month so I cooked my own food. The huge refrigerator is awesome. 

The only thing is the wall is thin like some reviewers have mentioned previously. I could hear people talking and walking but it didnt bother me since it's quite during the sleep hours.

The pictures look great, but the actual apartment does not measure up. After I made the reservation and paid over a thousand dollars, Nicole sent me a message asking me to lie to the tenants in her building if anyone asked why we were there, as her building does not allow Airbnb rentals. I was confused and dismayed that I was being put in this position; it was tacky. Next, when we arrived at the apartment, we couldn’t load our own groceries as the refrigerator was completely full with personal items. There was a stack of stuff on the dining room table and the bench at the table had legs that were bent and seemed broken, so we couldn’t sit there. The sofa was discolored and stained. When one of our guests sat in the bed, it broke. And then the host demanded that we pay for it! After renting houses/apartments numerous times on Airbnb, this was my first disappointment."

The park has an outdoor gym, track, sports and play areas,  and  it's really easy to walk to the riverside and enjoy the breezes. We found the apartment really roomy and comfortable for being isolated, cheerful and well equipped in every way.  Terrific beds, showers and kitchens!  It's also quiet - of course, traffic is way down, but we heard only 1-2 sirens during the couple of weeks we stayed, and that's very unusual in NYC."

The place is fabulous and I would highly recommend. I stayed for an extended stay 3+ months as I moved to NYC. I chose this place over corporate housing as wanted somewhere that felt a little more homely and had some of the creature comforts I am used to. 

The place is great and attention to detail on everything is a welcomed touch with an extended stay. I had a lot of the home comforts I am used to and everything in the place is high quality and it is a very stylish environment.

The team were truly exceptional in terms of service and response time . Everything was very professional and any questions or concerns were dealt with in an incredibly speedy way.

I would highly recommend a stay here and as a result I will definitely be looking at potentially staying in other of their properties."

And if you’re going to lock the main gate that travelers need to access the main point of entrance you should teach them how to properly open it, so that they are not stuck outside at 3am with all their belongings inside your home and them not knowing if they ever get inside, them also not wanting to be super inconsiderate and ringing the door bell that late at night, just for them to be accused of things that didn’t take place the following day after leaving everything the way it was found...Thanks"

He complained about EVERYTHING from our footsteps to how we closed the door, what kind of food we could cook, what utensils are untouchable in the kitchen etc. At a point he ordered us out that our food was smelling bad! 
I’ve never had the misfortune of meeting such a terrible fellow. Very impolite, outrightly disrespectful. 
He made our stay so uncomfortable that we had to be moving within the house on tiptoes like ghosts and sitting on the floor in our bedroom to eat so he doesn’t come and shout on us. If we had enough money on us to get another place we would have moved out within 24hrs of getting into that house.

If you want to stay in Aj’s place, tell her to keep her boyfriend out of the way, the guy was a nightmare! 
Aj herself is ok but she has no control over her boyfriend’s bad attitude which is quite unfortunate."

You'll have your own independent entrance, bathroom, and bedroom. There are small inconveniences, such as low ceiling (I am 190 cm and I have to bow my head a little) and lack of kitchen, but everything else is great for the price. It took us about an hour or an hour and 20 minutes to get to Manhattan. Also, we had a very late check-in and it wasn't a problem at all."

However, the neighborhood isn't all that great. The area is poor, most stores are run down. The bodegas around there do not offer a lot of options for food.. Its just all very ugh. If you don't have a car, honestly forget about it. It takes 2 hours to get to midtown by transportation and that's if the buses show up. The host was okay ... I've stayed there for 3 weeks and I've ran into her maybe 3-4 times. Everytime I ran into her there was never a hello, how you doing, it was always a complaint. She told me that I can't smoke my cigarette outside her house because the smoke goes thru the walls and she's ""asmatica."" I gotta go on the main street on the corner. Or that I can't leave more than one pair of shoes downstairs, even though I'm obligated to take my shoes off upon entering her house. Random messages at 11pm at night saying turn off the light and that she knows it's me cause the camera saw.. If youre just looking for a place to crash you might not get that much peace and quiet..."

I didn’t have any problem finding Street parking in front of the home. There were no parking rules in front of the home which made it convenient for me to leave my car and walk to the bus stop. Surprisingly it was very quiet on the street especially at night. Of course when the weather was nice there were lots of people out enjoying Spring which was nice to see especially during these turbulent times.

We got engaged at the top of the Empire State Building. We are glad that we stayed in a quiet and safe neighborhood that is only 3 blocks from the train, shopping, and restaurants. 

There are many things to see and do in Brooklyn, New York that are close to the apartment including the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn College, Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Academy of Music, and much more. Of course we visited Manhattan which is easy to reach with the 2 or 5 train a few blocks from the apartment.  

Myles made us feel like family and we are delighted that we stayed in his stylish newly renovated apartment. The 3 beds were very comfortable and have nice pillows, blankets and sheets. There are fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors in every room. The furniture is new and stylish. 

The private entrance to the apartment is easy to access with a keypad door code.

The bathroom was super clean and  includes towels, shampoo, a hair dryer and curling iron. There is also a full first aid kit.  The kitchen is very clean and includes a refrigerator, oven and many dishes, folks, and glasses.

Myles lives upstairs and responds very quickly to messages. Myles is very helpful, caring and definitely a super host. He exceeded our expectations. Thank you  and god bless you. We hope he comes to visit us in Budapest, Hungary. :)"

My boyfriend and I stayed here for his birthday and he loved every moment. As many has mentioned the pool is bigger in person than it looks on the picture. The apartment was VERY clean! Which is a major plus in my book. The overall apartment felt very comfortable and homely. The other amenities beside the pool made the place even more great. The big tv by the pool, the games, the great lights everywhere. Journey was a great host. He was very nice and easy to talk too. He explained all we needed to know and left it up for us to contact him with any questions if needed.  If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway then this is the place!"

Everything is provided for you including furniture, tv, all kitchen cookware, appliances, and even the little pre-packaged shampoos and soaps that you are given in actual hotels. 
I only needed to reach out to the host a few times (in 3 months), but when I did, they always responded the same day and often within the same hour. 
Unfortunately, my stay was cut a couple of weeks short (I chose to leave early) due to the COVID19 pandemic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the time I did have there. 
It really is in a great location, the building is VERY quiet for the most part, and there are plenty of good restaurants/grocery stores/other shops within an extremely short walking distance. 
If the price seems a tad rich, just know that literally everything is provided for you. I moved in and out with just a couple of suitcases and an extra small tv. In new york city, that is a huge mental and monetary relief. 
Highly recommended!"

He gave me a spare key and explained the house rules clearly to me.  Room is clean and stylish.  Host provided a few disinfecting wipes in a small ziplock bag due to the Coronavirus epidemic. The bed was comfortable and the apple tv came in handy.  The room faces the basement side and is supposed to be very quiet.  Unfortunately someone in the building was throwing a party and had the music blasting until 4am. There’s also a 24 hour habibi deli that has delicious food.  Absolutely loved it.

A curtain to mask a glass door and consider it privacy. I left the room untouched because I was so uncomfortable and checked out early. The host lied on my review which I assumed he qould do based on his treatment to strangers. I used the towels because the shower was filthy amd full of trash and stains. 

Bring extra comforters, a washcloth, soap, lotion, plates, ice, water, a real door, EVRYTHING!! All that is provided is towels.All tjat glitters is not silver or evwn bronze.

We survived and were not arguing we were motivating each other to hurry and leave. Once getting outside we jumped for  joy that we made it out. 

Never again"

He also informed me the room I was at didn’t have a lock and if I didn’t trust him take my belongs with me when I leave the apartment. I felt uncomfortable with that and him being there without a locked door so asked if I could bring a guest and he declined saying the room only fits one person (the room was big enough for two). I was completely unhappy, and uncomfortable so I booked another Airbnb for the night and left Xaviers place. 

I would definitely NOT recommend this place because of how I as treated. The place was very clean, and nicely decorated but the hospitality was horrible."

Timo is a great host. He helps you with everything you want to know and has some good tips for your journey.
The apartment and your room are in a good condition and offer everything you need for your time in New York and more. I really like the style of the apartment and felt comfortable from the first second.
Communication with Timo is easy-going, from getting into the apartment to leaving it there was no trouble. He even offered me a refund, because I needed to leave earlier due to the Coronavirus.

So over all it‘s great to start your NYC adventure here, I totally recommend it and would come back for myself as well!"

We just happened to go when the Corona virus happened.  Joyce bent over backwards to help us get our money back as we had to cut our vacation short.  She called AirBnB and got them to return half of our money back.   I'm very grateful to her for that as I'm sure the hold times were very long. 

Joyce's place was super convenient and close to all the things we wanted to do.  She had everything we could need and was very responsive to any requests. Everything was extremely clean when we got there and she fulfilled any requests we had. 

She had all of the amenities and also left snacks for us when we arrived. She met us outside when we first arrived and gave us a tour of the air bnb, which most hosts do not do. We loved our experience with her and if we go back to New York, she will be the person we'll book with again."

I have not yet been reimbursed for the 5 days I was not there for. I don't know who is at fault here -- the hosts or Airbnb. It's been frustrating, to say the least. I'm inclined to blame Airbnb; on the other hand, the hosts refused my request for reimbursement. On the third hand, I understand the hosts' concerns about losing money. On the fourth hand, I'm out a LOT of money; this would not happen at a hotel. As for the apartment. It's a perfectly serviceable graduate student-type place on a wonderful block. St. John the Divine is at the end of the street. The Hungarian Pastry Shop is also right there. It's a fabulous, long-standing Columbia hangout. The apartment is very warm (typical NYC apartment feature) so you'll want to keep the windows open in winter. You look onto a large airshaft, so don't expect much of a view. Place is mostly quiet. A couple decided to have a screaming session in the middle of the night once, so that was disconcerting as their yelling echoed up the airshaft. The kitchen is well-stocked. Nice having an elevator. Place is small, but serviceable for one person."

We informed Jessy about the rat problems two days into our stay and she refused to address the problem. She started being flaky and stopped responding until the next day. We asked her to shorten our trip since we booked it for a month but she refused to do so.
So we had to Contact Airbnb, and they let us know that we can checkout the next day but we were informed at 2am ( while we were sleeping). So we were asleep and she barged in our privacy. She kicked us out without giving us anytime. We had 10 mins to pack everything ( stuff for an entire month ) and leave while she was there cleaning. She kept telling us to move in the middle of us already panicking and leaving. She even told us to
Use mint spray against the mice that was located under the sink, this only suggests that she was already aware of the mice problems and refused to add it on her description. Please don’t book this place for your safety and to avoid being treated like shit. As soon as we had to
Checkout, Jessy dropped her nice act and started being disrespectful towards us."

It felt like home to an extent where I didn’t want to leave. It was close to everything that was needed, supermarket, CVS, Restaurants, and even a nice stroll by the pier. The Intrepid is a renowned ship and its the perfect place to sit and eat a meal. The docks are two blocks away and was one of my FAVORITE places to visit. The view of New Jersey across the water is impeccable during sunrise. The area is safe, clean, and very close to everything.

Zack was there to welcome me when checking in even though it was already late in the night. The apartment is huge (really huge) and has very high ceilings with a lot of natural light. Even though the entrance and the stairs are not the cleanest (which is probably the case with all older NYC apartment buildings), the apartment was very neat and clean and had the amenities I could ask for my long stay including the kitchen. Zack had decorated the room with a very keen sense of style and it was full of books which made me feel a lot more at home than a temporary place to live. The rooms are pretty sound proof so even if there is someone in the living room or their room watching TV, you cannot hear anything in your room."

Erst kam 1-2 Tage keine Antwort aber uns fiel direkt auf, dass es kühler wurde.

The house is in good shape with many amenities. Cooking and laundry is very convenient.

Paolo is discreet, works a lot and will always arrange for you to have a good time at his place.

Bedroom is spacious and ideal for two people. It has a closet with hangers and shelves. Wifi is always on so I use my computer and my tablet to stream videos and work from this place you can call a home due to its privacy. There is absolutely not noise when it comes to nighttime and in the morning you wake up to the birds singing. The place is strategic because it has the subway station a block away, many shops that sells good food and more banks than anything. South of this location you have the beautiful Coney Island beach and North, you have the amazing spectacular Prospect Park ideal for morning exercise, running, biking or reading a book. Most important, Host is very caring and respectful and work with you to have a great staying. Highly recommended!

For the value, Susan's place is very worth it. 

The area itself is a bit noisy. Downtown Brooklyn is in a period of immense gentrification/ rebuilding and so there is nearly 24/7 construction noise. Parking (once unsuspended in NYC) will definitely be an issue in this area as well.

The Vinegar Hill neighbourhood is tres chic with a few super cute boutique-y restaurants and cafes. The apartment is about a 5 minute walk from DUMBO and Brooklyn Bridge Park with all its amazing views and waterfront walks.  Also loads of great restaurants and shops in DUMBO. Excellent public transport links, a short walk to the York Street metro station and there's a Citibike dock right out the front of the apartment building, I also took the bus around Brooklyn a couple of times.

Gabriela was very quick at responding at all times of the day and graciously accommodated my needs and questions. She was flexible and I really appreciated it. A few things to note:

1. I was not bothered at all about not tossing toilet paper into the bin. Plumbing worked fine for me. Water in the shower can get quite hot.
2. The kitchen is relatively small. It has a hot plate and essentials, but bare with other cooking supplies. There’s a blender if you need it. It had what you need to make simple meals and heat up food.
3. There was an iron! I was pleasantly surprised since I read there was not one. 
4. Pulling into the parking spot was very tight. The road becomes more dirt and less paved. Drive carefully with a bigger car since it’s a sharp bend. However, there is plenty of street parking around. 
5. It’s very conveniently located to groceries, food, shops and the highway.
6. It is a basement apartment so it can be considered noisy. I don’t really recommend it for people who are light sleepers since you can hear upstairs with a decent volume. However, they are very reasonable about keeping quiet during nighttime hours."

The shower in particular took some time to be able to get a good temperature. Love how serene it is just outside the door. It is incredibly noisy from upstairs during the morning and into the evening (sound travels very easily inside), but this was not a problem for us one bit, as quiet hours were respected. Bright light early in the morning here- glad I brought my sleep mask. Also surprisingly chilly inside, especially at night.

She responded quickly to any messages and her answers were always helpful. Mary was also extremely compassionate and accommodating throughout the pandemic, quarantine, etc., which I really appreciated! 

The apartment is surprisingly spacious. The bedroom has room to move around, which hasn’t always been my experience in New York apartments. It also has a large dresser and decent size closet, and (as a person who has a lot of clothes) I had no trouble fitting my clothes, etc, in there! There is also a comfortable sitting area and some space at the kitchen island to do work or to eat. 

I also couldn’t speak more highly of the location! The neighborhood is comfortable and friendly, and gives easy access to really fun places in Brooklyn, as well as lower Manhattan. I worked in the financial district while living there and my commute was really simple!"

Unfortunately it's not the best option for someone who needs to rest because during the day, the family living upstair is too noisy and during the night, one roommate uses the kitchen and the bathroom every hour since he doesn't sleep during the night.
The shared spaces are too dirty and during the 3 weeks that I spent here, the common spaces were cleaned just once. I'd suggest the hosts to take care of the house better since it's very nice and potentially it can be a very nice place to stay.
The neighborhood is quite and safe."

Jennifer est très à l'écoute, son appartement est très propre, la décoration est vraiment sympathique. Il faut environ compter 30 à 40 min de métro et 15/20 min en uber (je vous conseille l'application lyft qui est moins chère aux États-Unis) jusqu'à Time Square.

Ci han dato un nuovo lock con dentro la nostra chiave. Entriamo, e la porta di ingresso è rotta quindi chiunque puo accedere all'appartamento.. arrivati in camera notiamo che la camera non era quella che avevamo prenotato. le lenzuola erano presenti solo nel letto di sotto, senza considerare che non c'era il piumone considerando che a marzo la temperatura scende ancora a 0  gradi di notte.
Passiamo alle zone comuni:la cucina abbiamo deciso a prescindere di non varcarla mentre il bagno era sporco e pieno di peli... la doccia/vasca faceva era orribile e  tutto girava attorno a un 1 m2 di spazio. cartigenica inesistente... se finiva veniva messa il giorno dopo e infine il divano che si vede nelle foto non esiste.

ovviamente i coinquilini decidono di fare la doccia alle 4 di mattina mettendo la musica e quindi è impossibile dormire, accompagnato dal fatto l'unico modo per riscaldarsi in camera è un riscaldamento a tubo che inizia a scaldare dopo mezzanotte e sfiata tutta notte.
diamo 1 solo perche 0 non si può dare... EVITATE QUESTO ALLOGGIO. (il quartiere non è de migliori,c'è solo la metro a 7 minuti che è comoda)
Per concludere vi dico solo che l'host che non ci ha neanche risposto al cellulare ci contatta subito dopo che scade l'orario del check-out scrivendo che siamo stati fantastici e che volevano 5 stelle di recensione."

Firstly it has no heater that could leave the room warm and cozy, but a little portable heater that one will take for camping. Additionally, bed linens were not washed prior to my arrival eventhough I checked in later than anticipated. Host was very inconsistent in communicating with me. Initially host was on top it, but after I checked in host was very much unresponsive. Host makes me feel like it was all about getting my money and not providing me the service I paid for."

The place was very nice and I can tell newly renovated. There is quite a few steps up to the apartment but it was worth it and works great with the NYC experience.

Комната в доме, поэтому вход отдельный с заднего двора, где можно выйти утром попить кофе например) 
Единственное о чем хочу предупредить вдруг кому это важно:
1. Тк помещение полуподвальное, есть запах канализации, особенно в районе телевизора. Проветривание не помогает и пока ты в комнате привыкаешь но когда приходишь с улицы очень неприятно. 
2. Очень слышно насос когда кто то включает воду, видимо он находится где то в комнате

So, the apartment is much smaller than it looks in the pictures. The room is also much smaller and not all of the furniture appearing in the pictures are there. Though, the bed was great and we had a closet, a drawer and a small desk. 
When we arrived, there was a mouse trap giving the impression that there were mice, but luckily we didn’t see any. Also, the doors of the closet are broken so you see all of the clothes hanging. We also had to activate the smoke detector ourselves, but it was fixed in 5 minutes. 

The kitchen is also very small, but we managed. The problem here is that there’s no extractor hood so everytime you cook something, you have to open the windows. 

The other person in the apartment, Mor, was very friendly and understanding. When we had an issue, she immediately helped with it. Though, she also has a lot of stuff so she keeps some of it in the hallway and kitchen, which makes it quite messy. But addressing the issue, she removed some of it. 

The location of the apartment is excellent! A grocery store (Key Food) at 5 min walking, an amazing diner (Midnight Express) also at 10 min walking and the subway is just at the corner of the street. Also, there almost wasn’t any noise at night from outside. We felt very safe. 

Overall, we still had a great experience and the communication with the host, Sol, went fluently, even though we never saw him."

The heating system is automatic and gets hot; solution crack the window unfortunately it does not stay open and nothing to hold it open.  At least it kept the loudness off the street out. The host was late communicating (After I called/sent many several messages and had already arrived) so if you have no internet access/foreign phone you are on your own or in my case pay premium for roaming charges. There was a lack of welcoming/human warmth or interest. More like a quantity business... Next! (Website hidden by Airbnb) 2 quick minutes repeating a soulless script and that was it. Additionally one of the other guests ( I can only speculate a long term guest/rental) seemed to be annoyed that there were other guests and could not enjoy the place for himself and visiting friends. In fact when I arrived he turned me away and said I was in the wrong place (Website hidden by Airbnb) The kitchen was messy and dirty items just stayed there (Website hidden by Airbnb) bathroom for everyone is just not enough so be ready to wait. Not a pleasant experience at all. My worst experience ever in Air b n b and not an opportunity to communicate it in person/talk about it and find a viable solution/improve. I only stayed on because of the virus situation and was just exhausted of my long journey."

The building is quiet and safe. The host, Meg was very prompt & helpful whenever I contacted her about any issues which were very minor.  The only funk I had was that the walls are very thin and I could hear the upstairs neighbors arguing often at times when trying to rest but it’s common with apt buildings in the city and often times comes with the territory but Meg & Mat still deserves more than 5 stars! I felt right at home. Thanks for the experience!"

Die Treppe ist eher steil und das Apartment befindet sich auf dem vierten Stock, ich hatte viel Gepäck und somit etwas Mühe hinauf zu steigen, ist aber ein gutes Workout :) .

I stayed at this AirBnB for a month. Very spacious two bedrooms, 3 beds with a pull huge pull out sofa. Very convenient to have a parking spot right out front (for those who drive). I’m a night shift worker so the blackout shades were great. The area is very good, nice to walk around. Stores and restaurants located close by, some even at the end of the street. Located right off a major street and a park. At the park there is a breathtaking, beautiful view of NYC. Washer and dryer located in basement. About 20 minute drive to manhattan NY. Lincoln tunnel is only 10 minutes away. 
Downsides: Due to uncontrollable circumstances, there was no maid prior to my arrival, so I did have to clean the AirBnB. Also I was asked to clean it when I left but the host refused to return any money for the cleaning fee... There is some wear and tear to the apartment on the walls. Also the hot water in shower was warm but not hot on most days. There is a strange mildew or condensation build up on bathroom heater. If you can’t walk up a lot of stairs then this is probably not the spot for you. There is about 15 stairs to get to the front door. And another 15 to get to the actually AirBnB apartment door. Random
 ant issue, would not recommend leaving food out. Also with packages be sure to put 40A instead of 40 64th street. The next door building is 40, so it will be delivered to the wrong apartment. 

Overall, I really did have a good stay. There were some issues with the AirBnB, but the host did try to correct as many as she could. I wish the place was cleaned prior to arrival especially with COVID right now but I’m grateful for the host and her husband extending their AirBnB to me. With some TLC this could be an even better AirBnB."

He is an extremely welcoming guy playing absolutely the same sheet of music with his guests. He was sooo kind to give us an opportunity to use bathroom, living room and everything we needed after we have checked out. The apartment is located in a very close proximity to subway stations.

Nice spacious home with tall ceilings. Every room has it’s own t.v with Netflix included. That is my favorite part about this home because most Airbnb’s don’t have a t.v in every single room but Paul’s place does. The beds are nice and soft and extremely comfy. Paul and kiara’s communication is through the roof they respond quickly and they’re on top of anything I needed, as far as new sheets, toilet paper, and paper towel, Lysol etc. The kitchen as every thing you need, I loved cooking in the kitchen. The living room is so big with a big t.v. I just love it here didn’t want to leave. Hope you book with Paul you won’t regret it. I promise (:"

However, I was quite disappointed when I moved in. First of all, no one told me that the second bathroom was being refurbished. Second the room was not clean when I moved in and even after, it has never been cleaned except by myself. Common areas were never clean. We did no have hot water or heating for a week. Cockroaches were running around the place from time to time. The promised laundry room was not working for the entire stay. Above that, in the middle of my stay, Stoop announced that the were moving out of the apartment leaving us tenants without WiFi (which was also promised in the description). While Nina always responded about complaints, her responses took quite some time and were mostly not really helpful. I know that most of the problems we faced were not her fault but I would have expected better assistance from her part and a far better customer service. I am really disappointed with Stoop. It was definitely not worth my money. If you can avoid it, don’t book with them ever."
"5499","24313537","620241145",2020-03-21,32202591,"David","The place is a little dark due to a lack of natural light, the climate of the apartment can be difficult to manage (but that is the way with most old Manhattan building south of 23rd), and I would find it tight for 5-6 people. That is the only negatives I can say.

Gahee was the best host I've had in NYC. Communication was amazing. The cleanliness of the apartment as well as the amount of mod cons was top.

The apartment is sandwiched between St. Marks Place, and Houston so they is plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants, but it should be noted the block of the apartment is quiet. The M15 runs a block over, and on Houston you can get an F train in no time. Very handy.

N.B. The apartment is up a couple of flights, it isn't a big deal to myself, but just for older guests perhaps."

It has a nice outdoor space with comfy benches and pillows. A backyard space where one can relax is rare in NYC so this was a great extra. The location in the Upper East Side of Manhattan is central to every NYC has to offer. The subway, beautiful parks, cute shops, and endless restaurants/bars are all very close. 

The beginning of my stay was a but bumpy with some miscommunication regarding the instructions. Also, the internet was not working on the day I arrived. The host remedied the internet issue within 24 hours. The only other negative was I saw a mouse in the kitchen. I know mice are an issue in a lot of NYC apartments. I let the host know and he plans on taking care of it. Other than that, the studio apartment is great."

You can very easily access the local bikeshare and bike paths, or just walk easily to a number of great places. AMAZING PRICE for what you get. Also, the building itself is relatively new construction and well maintained. 

I also picked this location because it's right by the East River running track (and the East River running paths) - the track is still open during COVID quarantine. During non-quarantine times, you're also right by the big public pool at Hamilton Fish Park (there's a small pool just a block north on 10th st as well). There is also a building ""gym"", which has a Cybex model treadmill, stationary bike, and elliptical (with elevation!). There are no freeweights, though. The gym is right on the main floor, no lock. 

You're nearby a ton of affordable grocery stores, and the kitchen is small but functional. There's a wide array of spices and condiments at your disposal as well. 

The room itself is ground floor, but it faces the back, and it overlooks the ""backyard"" on the basement level, so there aren't people milling around outside your window, and it's overall very very quiet (for NYC). There were also a couple nice touches I appreciated in the room, like plenty of shelf space and a long clothes rail for your stuff, and the fact that the bed had one super fluffy pillow and one thinner pillow, so that you can choose your preference. There are blackout curtains, and because you're facing the courtyard, I also noticed that the room doesn't get very overheated during the day (there's an AC anyway). 

Kaptan is also a great host himself - warm and friendly when you want to chat, but totally cool if you want some space to yourself, too."

The toillet is super uncomftable and you have to put your clothes in unless you have no Trouble with the cameras right in Front. 

The Place is not as described. I decides to ask for a refound, so I Took pictures of the Place to send to airbnb and they approved it. 

So das to See there Are Places like this one being rent on airbnb."

You will have your own entrance, private bath, and a private bedroom with fabulous views of Brooklyn from our 11th floor private balcony (not to mention floor to ceiling windows).  The bed is comfy, the towels are high quality and the bathroom is very European.  You will find the apartment SPOTLESS and well equipped. Your hosts are both delightful and helpful. 

You are right around the corner from the G line with easy connections to anywhere you need to go.  Great coffee and pizza right on the corner.  A great breakfast at Urban Vintage is just another block. We had an easy walk to the Barclay Center and to Prospect Park.  It is about a 30 minute train ride to Times Square.  We did the G to 7 and the G to A.  Both were easy and the times were similar. 

We found this to be a great place to stay and highly recommend The Wild West for your next trip to Brooklyn, but remember you are convenient to anywhere in the city."

El barrio esta lleno de sitios donde poder comprar y comer a todas horas, pero no esperes un sitio bonito pues la limpieza brilla por su ausencia y los personajes abundan, aun así, es seguro. La entrada en el apartamento fue un poco difícil, ya que el código que nos facilitó, no correspondía con nuestra caja (es un poco Saw, ya que las cajas donde están las llaves, no corresponden con el bloque, en el que te vas a alojar) pero la comunicación fue fluida con el anfitrión y nos solucionó el problema. Por último el piso es como veis en las fotos, un salón grande con nevera, un cuarto de baño para tres habitaciones (tienes que ser rápido por la mañana, yo me llevé chanclas y fue un acierto, la bañera no esta en buen estado) y la habitación que nos tocó (la número 3) es espaciosa, la cama es mas bien blanda, nos dejaron toallas y la limpieza era la justa. EL PROBLEMA: tiene en el techo una enorme CLARABOYA imposible de tapar, ni cerrar. Si te toca esta habitación llévate un antifaz o la claridad no te dejará dormir.
Si quieres un sitio barato y con metro cerca en NY, este es tu alojamiento. GRACIAS!"

The location in east Harlem is obviously a bit far from downtown Manhattan but the transport connections are very convenient.

"5686","25188424","620851190",2020-03-25,7046386,"María","My partner and I booked Lina and Steven’s place for a long-term stay between January and April 2020. I was going to live in the apartment full-time while my partner travelled back and forth from Europe. Booking their place was the best decision ever. 

First of all, the apartment is fantastic: it is spacious and beautiful, and it has absolutely everything you need, including a smart TV, a washing machine and a dryer. It is very close to the Nostrand avenue subway station, but not close enough to hear any subway noises. It is extremely clean, quiet and calm. It has a beautiful back garden, and I really enjoyed sitting by the kitchen window and having a cup of coffee while I enjoyed the sunshine and the garden view. Our stay was already worthy of the five stars because of the apartment and the very warm welcome Lina & Steven gave us. They left a bottle of prosecco and some coffee in the fridge for us. They introduced us to their lovely dog Lawford and even had us over for wine one night. On my first week in New York, while my partner was away, Lina took me out for coffee and showed me around in the neighbourhood. They made us feel welcome, were quick to respond to any questions and were definitely the best AirBnb hosts we have ever stayed with. 

Then the COVID-19 crisis hit, and they did much more than being excellent hosts. I had to cancel the rest of our stay and quickly return home. Not only did they completely understand and made it easy for me to move out in a rush, but they also went out of their way to help me. They edited the booking so I wouldn’t have to pay for the remaining weeks, and on top of that they offered to pay for my taxi to the airport. Their hospitality and kindness was overwhelming. I cannot recommend booking with them enthusiastically enough. This is an amazing apartment with even more amazing owners."

We enjoyed the private garden access with an awesome ping pong table and beautiful outdoor furniture. And we loved the place itself - every single piece of furniture and design detail is thoughtful, from the plates to the stunning rugs. We had ZERO issues whatsoever with any unwanted critters and that was a relief considering they're out with a vengeance during this time looking for food. When my sister (bless her) broke the sink, Seth was so thoughtful and kind and helped immediately. The place came fully stocked with soft towels, toilet paper, and paper towels. The neighborhood is also full of charm and there are so many amazing restaurants nearby that we ordered on Seamless, including what became my favorite Cuban restaurant. My family and I went to Seth's Airbnb so we could be together during this difficult time and Seth did everything in his power to make us feel at home. This is a a gorgeous place and I couldn't recommend it more. 5 Stars. Thank you, Seth!"

It's outside the hustle and bustle of the City, but it's also in a more tranquil part of Brooklyn itself. Gabriel's description of the place is spot  on: modern architecture meets minimalist design meets millennium tech touches. But the real reason to stay is that Gabriel is a full-on superhost: the place is immaculate, comes with all the trimmings, he is attentive to your needs and he clearly wants you to feel at home. At this particular time in history, when the country—and New York, in particular—is in some turmoil, coming back to this place is like finding a peaceful retreat. Don't hesitate to stay here if the opportunity presents itself."

Check in and out was remotely guided and went smoothly. The photos and descriptions turned out to be very accurate. Having a minifridge, microwave and tea station was very nice touch. The mattress was really comfortable. Place was clean and shower was hot. We were very satisfied with the value we got for the money. Just one thing, the comforter is usually difficult to wash and we were a bit taken back because there was no sheet under the comforter and it didn’t have a removable outer envelope sheet that could be easily washed. So we were a bit concerned. Adding a single bedding sheet under the comforter would be very comforting to the guests (no pun intended). And perhaps a bedside lamp. But, overall this place is a great economy option for staying in NYC. Recommended. Thanks Hardeep!"

Otherwise, I would not recommend it in terms of location. The room is tiny and a window faces the inner “garden” so the room might seem a bit gloomy, also you will be hearing people chatting outside. The apartment is quite noisy, we heard water running through pipes all the time. My friend who’s a light sleeper couldn’t sleep at night. On our second night, some people with a child moved in so it was unpleasant because of baby crying, the walls are thin so you will be hearing people fighting :). Also, my friend said her back hurt because the bed was uncomfortable. I’m a heavy sleeper and can sleep anywhere, so that wasn’t a problem for me. I liked the kitchen, but the refrigerator was full and there was almost no room for my groceries. If you’re an introverted person, just letting you know that you would have to ask for every small thing in the apartment because a host doesn’t provide any detailed information. The host let us keep our luggage in the apartment so that was really nice."

Right near the subway, easy to get to Manhattan, LIC, Astoria, etc. Helen is very accommodating and even made me food a couple of times! The bathroom is shared and the mattress or cot are in the living room area, but I was out of the apartment most of the time and Helen was respectful of my space when I was at home so this was not a problem. Definitely would recommend, especially for an affordable place to stay during a visit to NYC!"

Location close to train, but still on a quiet street. Thoughtful touches and basic kitchen condiments included.  Television and workspace makes for a good spot to rest or work in case it rains on Saturdays. Great sunlight in the apartment.  The garden doors to the apartment are generally kept open,  however, the bedrooms have doors with locks for privacy when needed.  Overall, great apartment and  Yvette gave a welcoming overview of the space."

The hospitality and thoughtfulness of Carlos and Yvette was beyond exceptional. Carlos went out of his way to explain everything with a tour of the house and how to work the locks and hot water. 
It was safe and I could walk/rollerblade outside at night. The bus stop and train were relatively close and little restaurant’s and fresh produce markets were easy to walk too. There’s a great pizza place called Louie’s just two blocks away. The space is quiet and comfortable on the second floor and it’s great to leave the window open at night and feel the fresh cold air.
There are two front entrance doors and the room has its own keyed lock which is rare. Keys are provided and I felt safe and secure at all times. 
Yvette takes out the trash daily and the place is fresh and very clean. Toiletries are provided and Yvette even provided a blender so I could make fruit smoothies. 
This visit I stayed for a week. I will be in town again soon and have already secured my room for future business travel dates. 
I want to say a huge thank you to Yvette and Carlos for exceptional service, many kindnesses and for making my stay almost as good as home. Thank you for introducing me to New York, thank you for being my new family."

The location is great and close to all amenities, Time Square, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Central Park, and Port Authority Bust Terminal (PABT) included. The flat and the room are nice for the price tag. Be aware of a window-less room, it is in the description, and Prav also mentions that fact everywhere. Don't be surprised then.

You don't find those little touches in a lot of Airbnb rentals.  My favorite thing about the room is it has its own bathroom. After a long day of stomping around NYC, it's so nice to come back to your own bathroom. The water pressure in the shower was excellent and had nice temperature control.

There is a private side entrance for you to come and go as you please without disturbing him and his family, who live in the main house. We had full access to the backyard and pool - Anthony & his family gave us a lot of privacy. You can play water volleyball & basketball in the pool as well, and that was a lot of fun. The jacuzzi is private - maybe because of the coronavirus. The basement was a little cold though, so definitely pack sweats and a sweater.  You have a lot of space in the basement with a full bathroom, tv with Netflix, pool, a fridge, a microwave and darts. Anthony was very nice & hospitable. We enjoyed our stay; we recommended to our friends already, and we would definitely come back!

Side note for any POC: we were definitely a bit uncomfortable before visiting this neighborhood and home at first, especially in today’s climate. We only encountered one issue where we were followed around Walgreens because they suspected we might steal. But besides that, everything was fine."

I had a party here with about 16 people and it was great . We all enjoyed ourselves and made sure we wasn’t too loud or extreme with the noise !!!

The floors in every room of the house appeared to have been mopped and swept very well. Each bedroom came with its own set of wash rag, towels, and soap; the beds were made up and appeared to have been washed before our visit. We did notice upon entering the Airbnb that there was a plate of cat food left out because a lady that lived downstairs would leave it out for the stray cats to eat from, which attracts a lot of flies to circulate the entrance of the home. We met the lady that lived downstairs as she was very welcoming and delightful but very distracted by her many cats. We had a little trouble with the hot water, but William made sure it was fixed right away. I truly enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend this place to anyone interested."

WHILE WE WAS IN THE HOUSE SLEEPING UPSTAIRS. THEN WE GO DOWN TO SEE WHOS IN THE HOUSE WE RENTED. She makes a call to William and he tells me bcuz I wanted to cancel, that he didn't think I was going to show up at the place.  And today in our check out, SHE ALMOST EVEN CAME UP TO BEDROOM TO KICK US OUT BECAUSE IT WAS 10:55AM AND CHECK OUT WAS AT 11am. We was completely dress and she stood in the house the whole time after she came in, and I asked her to leave, while we finishing up. SHE KEEP TALKING BACK AT US,  she keep saying that is her Job to be in the house to clean up. Super SUPER DISAPPOINTED. NEVER EVER BOOK FROM THIS GUY."

For guests visiting from out of town, this 1-bedroom apartment may seem small but for those who are familiar with Manhattan spaces, this accommodation is compact yet complete with all the essentials including a washer/dryer unit. And the little balcony facing the backyards of the surrounding brownstones is a rarity in the city itself. Situated in the neighborhood of Chelsea, the location is remarkable. Near the High Line, Hudson River Park, Chelsea Piers, Meatpacking District and in close proximity to art galleries, museums, restaurants and bakeries. All within walking distance. Justin was quick in responding to messages. He helped resolve an internet issue right away on the night of arrival. He graciously accommodated a late check out due to a special circumstance on the day of departure. I highly recommend Justin’s place and would love to come back!"

Justin was very accomodating, quick to respond, and thoughtful during the process. He did have to put me in a different (larger, 2br) unit because the housekeeper misplaced keys for the original listing, but everything worked out in the end. Quiet with a modest patio looking out into a shared courtyard. Shower drain is clogged though. I imagine if shops/etc were open, this would be a great central location. Chelsea Pier and Chelsea market are within walkable/biking distance too."

 Giovanna was a great host. I personally felt it was better than staying at a hotel, because it had the energy of a home. But Giovanna gave me my space, and wasn’t intrusive. She was very respectful and considerate. Basically, if you respect her and her home, she’ll respect you.

She was rude to me and would complain about everything. She is a pet friendly place and still had a problem with my animals. There are a lot of rules she has that is not specified in the house rules. During this whole pandemic it was difficult to eat out and she complained about me cooking, however she states in the house rules ‘light cooking’ is acceptable. Overall the place itself was nice and the area itself is a friendly neighborhood I just wish my host would have been more accommodating towards me, compassion is much needed In the world and sadly I didn’t feel welcomed In her home.

Her home was warm, inviting, very clean and neat.  We are originally from Brooklyn, NY so we knew how to get around and find everything that we needed or wanted.  She does offer directions if needed and places to go and things to do during your stay.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 virus outbreak happened during my visit but we took extra precautions and made sure to be very careful when outside her home.  My daughter has Asthma and I have multiple respiratory ailments (Asthma, COPD & Obstructive Sleep Apnea).  So we weren't trying to get infected or contaminated during ourstay.  Check-in and Check-out was very easy and simple.  Tami was there to great us when we arrived even after our flight was delayed and our arrival was 3 hours later than scheduled.  Tami you're an Awesome host and you have made a beautiful home for yourself.  Looking forward to staying with you again during our next visit...hopefully this pandemic will be over and things are back to normal around the country.

When we arrived to the place, we took a look around and there was hair on the bathroom floor. One of the rules was that you cannot wear shoes inside, but it felt so dirty we had to wear our flip flops when using the bathroom. And there was no type of hand soap in the bathroom. Secondly, the kitchen table and counters were dirty and there was food in the sink (strawberries and noodles), so we changed our minds about using this area. The room was neat and comfy. However, sleeping here was not ideal. In the mornings, the host, Mariana and a male individual were loud in speaking, opening cabinets and other kitchen appliances. There was also very loud banging from above the ceiling, it was constant the whole morning. I did not receive the greatest communication from Daniel. I reached out to him regarding our flights arriving early and asked if we could check in early, he didn’t respond. A day later, I sent another message asking for a response asap and thankfully he did allow us to. Similar instance occurred when asking to obtain a refund due to covid19, his responses were slow. The patio did not match the photos in regards to the furniture that is displayed. It was also very uncomfortable for us for our host to ask to say that we are not Airbnb guests if anyone asked, but his friends or family, etc. This is not something you want to worry about when out in vacation! All in all, I dont believe this private room is the worth the amount charged per night and I won’t consider returning."

"6014","26557748","622867497",2020-04-21,8950320,"Vanessa","First of all - the absolute best airbnb I have EVER stayed at. 

The apartment itself is adorable: sunny, private, peaceful, comfortable and all the perfect touches for a short or long stay. There is great sized kitchen and everything you would need - pots, pans, dishes, spices, multiple salts (!), Jared even has various coffees (and options in terms of brewing preferences), teas, amazing books, beautiful lighting and just tons of thoughtful touches. Living room is comfy and lovely with great Apple TV options. Bed comfy.

When the description says that it's homey enough to feel like you are staying in ""a home"" but not too personal that you are staying in ""Jared's home"" - it's exactly that. 

The neighborhood - the best. Right by the park, bars, restaurants, local marketings, boutiques, near everything - even a farmers market on Saturday am. A 5 minute walk to subway. 10 minute walk to Williamsburg in the thick of it. You have everything you need to feel like a local.

And lastly, and probably one of the important elements of a successful stay - the host was fantastic. Communication was great, honest and accommodating to my somewhat shifting situation.  I was staying here just recently, all  during COVID-19. Even so, Jared was super flexible and helpful and just all around awesome. 

Don't bother looking anyplace else in Brooklyn - this is the best choice to make!"

The house looks exactly like the pictures provided. My stay was ok, I just had a little problem. Some of the instructions weren’t really clear because I didn’t know that you had to rent the entire place(as gatherings), for you to have fun in the loving room, we could only party in the room and the volume gotta be very low. Mind you it was 7 of us and 4 people could barely fit in the room. It was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy myself. But rules are rules. Wasn’t big of a deal tho, I ended up going to my friends house to celebrate then came back to the place to sleep. But it was a good stay."

The place just always smelled cleaned which I love, especially for bathrooms I'm new to. I also love when Airbnb's have access codes, which Oscar's place utilizes.  They just make everything like check in much easier and guests dont have to worry about misplacing a key! I felt safe in the neighborhood,  even at night and there were many great restaurants around. The L train station is extremely close and we used that most of the time to get to Manhattan in 40-50minutes. Even though we ended up spending about half our time in the Airbnb because of COVID-19 things like Oscars gorgeous huge HD TV and close proximity to restaurants for ubereats and doordash kept us plenty entertained. Again, I really appreciated the cleanliness of this place, especially with COVID-19 rapidly spreading. The worst part, which personally I didnt mind, was that there seemed to be a basketball court or something right outside the window and the people playing could get a little loud, but i also understand that under normal, non virus related circumstances, we would have been out of the Airbnb a lot more and probably never would have experience that."

Also, the listing states that there is a washer and dryer in the building. My husband looked for it but never found it so we messaged Jack and he told us there was in fact one in the building but it didn’t work well, so we had to find a laundry mat. 

Other than that the place was per much as stated."

Located in trendy East Williamsburg, it is steps from the L-line subway (which is essentially on the same block but you barely hear it). There is a  vegan restaurant next door, across the street you'll find a deli and laundromat, a grocery store around the corner, and tons of restaurants, bars and shops within a two block radius. You'll likely find whatever you need within about a 5-10  minute walk. 

The apartment itself is a little small but well-equipped and stylishly decorated. The room is very spacious, clean and comfortable. The only downside was the limited sunlight due to there being only one small window but the air conditioner made up for that. The toilet is next door which could be a slight issue for light sleepers. However the room itself is sublime and I had no issue staying indoors during the pandemic.

Sue is an amazing host who always avails herself for her guests. She is communicative and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying this airbnb during your trip to NY. I will certainly be returning."

Indeed, the N line, which crosses Manhattan from North to South basically from Central Park to Brooklyn Bridge, is just 2 minutes walk away. I didn't try the kitchen, so I don't know about that. The neighborhood looks safe, I took a walk at nine in the evening without any problem. Only two problems, which took my stars down to 4 instead of 5. First, for the first two evenings we've had cold water of the shower. We told Cagkan only on the third day, because in the second morning the water of the sink was smoking hot, so we assumed that the issue was fixed also for the shower, which wasn't as we discovered in the evening. Anyways, after telling Cagkan, he took care of it immediately. Another problem is that in the little room there's also a water pipe coming from above, which means you would hear water pouring down from it whenever other residents take a shower. And when it happens at 5 in the morning, well, it's not nice... No blame to Cagkan for that, he was much available for everything. I'm just saying about a matter of fact of the room."

Con: bathroom is really beaten up and dated - Hooks ripped off walls, cracked porcelain, layers of grout, etc.  could def use a nice matched set of guest towels.  Kitchen a bit better, but again, please buy some decent cutlery, a good knife, and actual glasses.  Biggest downside is the insane barking from next door dogs.

The check-in was horrible, because the hosts just textet us when we were already on our way, that there is no normal way to check-in and that we should just wait in front of the building until someone comes around. So they wanted us to wait to walk with a random person together into the building. The hosts knew before that we will arrive around midnight, so obviously there was no one who entered the building at this time. We tried to contact the hosts, we called, we textet, and only after an hour one of the hosts arrived to let us into the apartment. It was midnight, in March in NYC, it was freezing cold!! 
The room was decent but stuffed with lots and lots of stuff from the hosts, as well as the rest of the apartment. There were several other rooms in the whole apartment, probably around 8 other rooms with other guest. So just 2 bathrooms weren't really enough. Also the rooms are all self-build, the ""walls"" are really thin and don't really reach the ceiling, it felt like we were living in one big room with a lot of other people. You can here EVERYTHING! It's super noisy. I mean we knew that the streets will be pretty noisy, and they were, but that was actually just fine, the problem were the not really existing walls. In addition, the hosts lived in the apartment as well, but ignored their own house rules all the time. They were super noisy, even around 4 in the morning, they smoked in their room so the whole apartment and our room smelled really badly. And obviously its not really cool that everything smells like weed when you need to go to an airport.

The location is excellent - Bushwick is a really cool and lively neighborhood and it's easy to get from the apartment to Manhattan using the nearby subway stations.

"6164","27080183","621541160",2020-04-01,7086125,"Anna","I stayed here for 3 months and everything is accurate to the photos. I never met Vera in person, but exchanged texts with her before and during my stay. 
POSITIVES are obviously the location and the washer/dryer, but you pay for that in the price. Vera (and the current roommate) let me leave my bike and suitcase in the apartment before I officially checked in, so that was nice. The apartment gets great light. The current roommate is also very friendly and accommodating. Downstairs door is a little sketchy but I felt mostly safe in the apartment. 

The NEGATIVES were: I had to deal with maintenance issues including no hot water, broken toilet and no internet - which meant staying home and waiting for handymen to come. Vera coordinated all of it from her phone but I found it really annoying to have to personally deal with the issues though I was only renting the room. Cleanliness wasn't a strong-suit here, the bathroom has mold all over the ceiling and walls that will need a professional to come clean it. The apartment is, in general, not kept clean. Vera wanted me to clean the space before leaving without offering me the cleaning fee I paid in return (over 100$). Your room is noisy at night with trucks and people (but that's NYC). Walls are very thin within the apartment, so you can hear the other person in their room and everything in the kitchen/living room. I only had two suitcases but if you plan on bringing a lot of stuff, there's not a lot of room as the space is full of Vera's things. 

If you're in-and-out most days (so, if COVID-19 ends), you don't work from home, you don't have a lot of needs, and you can afford it: it's a good spot."

During this time, Lena was kind and repeatedly helpful, especially during extreme times.  I would highly recommend Lena as a host and the apartment itself that is in a great location and has the exact amenities that anyone would need for a longer stay.  I can say all these incredible things about Lena and the apartment while having to spend a disproportionate amount of time in the apartment because it is where I was sheltering in place in NYC.  The layout of the apartment made it so that I was able to comfortably stay inside day after day and work as well as spend leisure time here."

There's a great shop on the corner (Mr. Kiwi), a train station half a block away (JMZ), and a full supermarket just another half block from there (Food Bazaar). Fernando was an excellent host and was always available if we needed something.

That said, this is not a fancy place. The train is right outside a bedroom window, so it's loud. It's on a busy street with lots of foot traffic and it's above a check cashing place. There are some cockroaches. It's spacious but utilitarian—you're not paying for aesthetic. But Fernando is a good host, it's a secure building with quiet tenants, and the beds are comfortable and clean.

We were here for a long stay, so we made full use of the kitchen, and everything worked fine. The bathtub could use a scrub, but it wasn't too bad. 

We did have some issues with the wifi cutting out, but Fernando got on the phone with the provider, came over to replace the router, and had it working the next day."

The host was so understanding and accommodating. A-B offered me a refund for all the nights I would not be able to stay anymore due to Covid-19.

My husband and I spent one night at this cleanly,  heavily sanitized, beautifully decorated, freshly smelling, AirBNB after our travel plans were canceled due to COVID-19.  It was his 50th Birthday and I must have mentioned it to Erica at some point during our communication.  When we arrived, we were surprised with Moet champagne, chocolates and red petals in a heart shape on the high quality, white bedspread. I was blown away by the royal welcome. (That's what it felt like)
In addition,  we had access to the luxury,  private outdoor hot jacuzzi and fire pit. This was hands down the BEST AirBNB I've stayed. Breakfast was included and healthy and delicious.  
This overnight stay turned out so romantic that we wanted to extend our stay but unfortunately, the AirBNB was not available for another night. 

I highly recommend this AirBNB for luxury comfort, its cleanliness, with modern furniture and new appliances.  The nearby beach is about a 5 minute walk with a boardwalk that stretch for miles. 

My overall experience, was lovely and felt like paradise. Erica helped to make my husband's 50th birthday a memory that we will never forget. 

I will definitely be reserving again. 

See you soon."

Erica went out of her way to make me feel at home. Easy check in and upon arrival I was greeted with a welcome package with wine, cheese and crackers. I never had to buy coffee water, or toilet paper as she had me stocked up for my entire stay. 

Many many times I was I was invited into their beautiful back yard for barbecuing and I felt like I was a part of their friends and family..Good hospitable people.

They had a wonderful area to relax after working and had a clean, very nice hot tub that unfortunately I did not get to enjoy due to weather but my next time there I will definitely take advantage of it.

Hospitality could not be beat anywhere. They always inconvenienced themselves to make sure I  had a place to park, she took me grocery shopping and showed me around the area, even took my husband to the airport. 
Erica was always making sure I didn’t want for anything and answered my texts immediately which was helpful when I got lost on the train. Lol..
Truly went above and beyond to make me comfortable in NY. 

If you ever are coming to NY you will not be disappointed in staying (Website hidden by Airbnb) a must do!!!!!

Everything the other reviewers say is true!

My stay at Erica’s was nothing short of epic. The space is way nicer than the pictures and just what I needed to break up the Coronavirus monotony. I booked this place because I craved some jacuzzi time. The jacuzzi is amazing and private. The outdoor space is huge. What really shined during my stay was the hospitality of Erica & John. They give the classic bed and breakfast treatment. We got the most delicious, restaurant-level breakfast. If you need a local, intimate getaway I highly recommend Erica’s place."

He really does set the ambience of the apartment and I enjoyed his conversations, his warm demeanour and the atmosphere he sets. I got to meet some of his clients and it is obvious that they hold him in high esteem as well. 

The apartment is very close to everything in Central NY, and I felt safe the entire time I was there. Thank you Sam for not only hosting me, but allowing me to enjoy your apartment each evening with a glass of Red wine and a little bit of Van Morrison or Rod Stewart playing in the background.

It's close to everything you need (there's a great grocery store about a 2 minutes walk away, a fantastic breakfast spot 1 minute away, and amazing coffee on every block). I stayed here for 3.5 months and did reach out to Sonder support twice in time there and the service I received was exceptional. They're super fast to action any request and also very friendly. The people who work at the front desk are always so welcoming. I will likely stay here again anytime I visit NYC. The financial district is a bit quieter than some other areas, but that's exactly what I wanted. Fulton station is just a short walk away and that can take you basically anywhere in the city. 

Going forward, I am always going to try to find a Sonder apartment available anywhere I am visiting. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a longer term rental."

The deposit for check in is 200$.  Which you get back when you check out if u use a credit card u get it right away.   And you do pay the tax later also.   Airbnb charges their fee and the room price.    At the end i do recommend it . For the price is def worth it"

The Airbnb apartment is the entire top floor of their brownstone, and for a couple we had complete privacy and lots of space. Sometimes we would hear the most beautiful piano music coming from downstairs, which we loved! We loved how much light their place gets from every window, and we cooked all our meals easily in their kitchen (which has a dishwasher!). We stayed 10 days so It also helped that they had a washer and dryer. Location is amazing too - 5 mins walk to Prospect Park and multiple restaurants, grocery stores,  and pharmacies!

It is located on the other side of the house meaning you need to lock your room if you need to go to the bathroom. The entrance to this room is near the entrance of the house itself and you will hear door slamming 24hrs a day so get used to that and a big NO if you wake up easy. People on the above floor will scream and shout at different times of the day and night. Bathroom is shared with 4 other rooms so you may or may not find it clean. God forbid you have any question for the host, you won't get any reply, so you are on your own. Good thing is location near trains and busses. Good luck."

The code to check in was not provided until the very last minute after prompting the host for it multiple times. Unfortunately my phone was dying when I arrived. Although the unit appears to be occupied by a host or helper no one offered any assstance to help me to check in, even after ringing the bell, which I found quite odd. The bell could be heard because I later found that I woke another guest trying to sleep. (This guest fell back to sleep and it is not their responsibility to admit me anyway.) Many of the amenities listed were unavailable to guests and my particular room had a dirty, uncomfortable mattress. Overall I was left with the sense that this is a cash grab with a host more interested in making a quick buck than providing a good experience for guests."

Apartment has everything you need for cooking, sleeping, lots of towels, crib and high chair for kids, solid wi-if, etc. Grocery store and bodega are a block away and downtown Brooklyn is an easy walk (gives you access to all major subways, tons of restaurants and bars, shopping, etc).

She sent me non stop messages the whole time about every little thing from blaming her dishes on me,  to demanding money from me for made up fees, knocking at my door constantly just random complaining and at times, even personally offensive things, from the first night i arrived until i finally just checked out early and got my refund because she was coming into my room with an extra key, unannounced to continue to demand money for fees she was making up as she went along. Luckily, I’m not stupid so I didn’t pay her. I also got a refund from airbnb for all remaining nights (so good on airbnb for that.) but I had to call airbnb support 4 different times during this very unpleasant stay. Psycho hosts like Dr. Jihene need to be taken off this site because she made it so unbearable i had to leave in the rain at night and go to a hotel. I had enough finally when she actually unscrewed the doorknob so that i couldn’t close the door after she all of a sudden thought i was smoking inside, came banging on my door and tried to charge me $600 so she could re-paint. She is a wannabe scammer. BEWARE: DO NOT STAY HERE, CRAZY, CRAZY HOST."

The studio is very nicely decorated and clean, I felt like I was home away from home. A lot of linens and towels are provided, the kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, utensils and pans if you do prefer to do some cooking. The bed is very comfortable, we slept like a baby.

It’s perfect for one to two people, might be a little crowded for more than three guests. There’s plenty of street parking, however there are multiple steps up to get to the house, so keep that in mind. Also, some parts of the ceiling run pretty low so if you’re more than 6 ft tall, just watch out for some areas. But it didn’t really matter much for us because overall we loved the place, we can overlook that tiny detail. 

Carrie is a very hospitable host, she sees to it that you are comfortable and your needs are met. 

I totally recommend 100%."

1) La reserva y el pago lo hice el mismo día , el anfitrión no me manda dirección alguna donde buscar las llaves.
2) Al llegar a la dirección señalada , no hay nadie que te reciba.
3) Al poder comunicarme con su encargada , ella no tiene la facultad de poder arreglar la situación .
4) Al poder comunicarme con el anfitrión , a través de la aplicación , me dice que me había mandado la explicación de donde buscar las llaves hace un par de días atrás a tal dirección 
( eso fue imposible , puesto que la reserva y pago se hizo el mismo día)
5) Al ir a buscar las llaves donde el dice me encuentro con dos sorpresas más:
A)Me da otra dirección donde queda su departamento.
B) Nadie sabe nada de las llaves en ese local. 
6) Traté de comunicarme con él por teléfono pero solo tuve una llamada perdida de California ( en su mensaje me dijo que estaba en Europa), cuando ya habíamos decido irnos a un hotel después de haber viajado 6 hrs en auto y haber esperado más de 2 horas para poder arreglar el problema 
6) Increíblemente al otro día , me ofrece un “trato justo “de devolverme solo 1 de los 2 días  pagados , puesto que lo tenía reservado para mi.

Lo anterior muestra una experiencia que no se la recomiendo a nadie , que pone entredicho la capacidad de solución de problemas del anfitrión , como así también , su nula empatía.

Espero de todas maneras que haya sido un hecho aislado , pero lo que me concierne a mí, son muchas coincidencias para ser coincidencias"

It's still the hood, but it's fine, and being only two blocks from Central Park is a great bonus. Being only steps away from the subway is very convenient as well. The apartment is on the second floor looking onto the street, facing south, so lots of light. It appears to be a studio that at some point was made into two rooms, so the rooms are small, but it works well. Plenty of closet space and the kitchen is well equipped. Everything very clean.

She greets her guests with warm snacks and refreshments, and she’s always around for help but gives her guests their space as well. The location is very central, 10 min walk to the 2&5 lines which take you anywhere you want to go in the city in around 45 minutes. Supermarkets and other stores are within walking distance. As a New Yorker and a host myself, I consider myself very lucky to have resided at this location for a month during this horrible pandemic. I recommend this place to all travelers."

I’m a Brooklyn boy so Bushwick is like home to me.  However, I wouldn’t stay again because of the neighbors living upstairs.  They were constantly outside smoking cigarettes and they would stay up very late into the night making noise, talking loud, and one night even playing music past 1 / 2am.  They seem to have no regard for anyone there and also seem rude and not friendly.  Although the apt is definitely worth the value I paid, I wouldn’t stay again because of the ghetto neighbors."

Before I booked I told Michael I was allergic to cats. We went back and forth with questions and responses on it, but ultimately I had a strong allergic reaction to Dragon. Putting a good air purifier in the room helped some. Other than that the 4 week stay was great. Nice, cool mixed neighborhood with a couple of parks close by, a comfortable bed, access to a kitchen and my own bathroom. A private bathroom is hard to find in NY so it was great to have. Many restaurants, bars, bagel places, pizza joints, thrift shops, markets, bodegas also very close. If no allergies to cats then then I highly recommend. If allergic, then talk beforehand with Michael."

It was really conveniently located in the East Village, surrounded by restaurants and grocery stores. While it was a 5th floor walkup, all those stairs were definitely worth it for the penthouse! The apartment was so thoughtfully decorated and was really soothing to come home to after busy days in the city. The apartment is fully furnished and had everything we needed to cook, as well as a washer/dryer, really nice soaps in the bathroom, and a great projector. The bed was also probably the softest thing I've ever slept on! We loved the quirky little swing, as well as the rooftop with a gorgeous view of the city. Jen was extremely responsive and went out of her way to make sure we had a great stay."

"6497","28367842","618065024",2020-03-14,310882097,"Ashley","Pros:
* Fiona is very responsive, she gets back to you within seconds with anything you may need.

* Awesome location and safe. (You are close to the A,B,C,D lines and 2 train--It is a 5 minute walk to the station and I was able to get to downtown in 25 - 30 minutes) 

* The Room and bathroom are very spacious and look just like the pictures posted.

* I had originally booked the room for 2 weeks, as I was in NYC training for work. However, my training was cut short due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fiona allowed me to cancel the remainder of my stay and graciously refunded me for the additional week I had booked.

* I was able to get a parking spot right in front of the house. I had no problems parking there for a week. You do have to watch your car and move it for street sweeping though.

Cons:
*If you are sensitive to noise, the walls are pretty thin so you can hear anytime a toilet is flushed from upstairs, conversations downstairs, etc. Nothing some headphones can't handle though  :)

* There is not a way to lock the main door to your room. You can lock the door leading into your closet and bathroom though. I didn't prefer this, because I didn't keep all of my stuff in the closet area. However, they have cameras (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you feel a little uneasy, Fiona will quickly look at camera footage and allow you to view it as well to ensure you that your stuff is safe.

* I had a few issues with smelling smoke given that the area where someone may smoke is outside, a floor down from your window ( I am an asthmatic, so Im very sensitive to this) . There is an AC unit in the window, so there is a bit of a crack left in the window. Sometimes, the smoke would waft inside of the room because of this. So, if you're sensitive to smoke just give Fiona the heads up so she can direct whoever is smoking elsewhere so it doesn't bother you."

The apartment itself was great, very clean and comfortable. The living area and master bedroom are very spacious and the bathroom is top notch. The building has a laundry room which is very handy. The location of the apartment is amazing. There are plenty grocery stores within walking distance and the subway is a stroll away bringing you to the heart of Manhattan in 15 minutes.

JoAnn is a great host. Whenever I had a question, I received reply within no time. I was greeted by an agent on my arrival who provided all the information I needed. My trip was cut short due to the Corona virus and JoAnn couldn't have been more gracious about it. I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in New York city!"

The room that I had was small and cosy, but it doesn’t really have a decent window and also it doesn’t open. There is no natural light really in the room and it’s pretty stuffy. Bed also feels pretty unstable.
Was not a social house but good for people who want to realx after their workday etc. Livingroom is beautiful."

It was a strange time for all of us, to say the least. Throughout that, she was unfailingly kind, thoughtful, understanding, helpful and supportive. She gave me tips on places to go and restaurants where I could get takeout. She communicated quickly and always super friendly.  When I thought I might be getting ill, she picked up items for me at the supermarket and pharmacy. I really can't thank her enough for her hospitality and making me feel so welcome and at home.

Her place is lovely - spacious and open, with a great little kitchen and modern bathroom. The apartment is situated in a real Brooklyn neighbourhood - you genuinely feel like you're part of the community and that this is the real New York City, away from the tourist postcard stuff; yet it's still only 20mins walk away from amazing sites like Prospect Park and the beautiful Botanic Gardens. I just wish I'd had more time there to explore, if it hadn't been for the virus!"

Walking distance to the subway, liquor store and grocery store. The house was very clean and provided all the amenities we needed. It’s is very deep into Brooklyn so, it does take time to get to all the main attractions. 

Upstairs neighbors, were a bit noisy. (Not sure if they were residents or other Airbnb guests. 

Some of our flights were delayed due to the Corona virus, we requested late checkout and were given access to a later checkout  which was very helpful. (Thank you)"

The room is a fair size for new york with a big window and a right size closet for one person.
Bathroom is clean and the living room is spacious and clean as well.
Pretty quiet area in woodside but the house is one block away from the main avenue which has a ton of places to eat in, supermarkets/pharmacies to shop at, and the LIRR and express subway station to hop on, which is perfect for commuting. Hiroki, the host, is always available by text. Once a week there is someone who comes to clean the common areas and takes out the garbage and keeps everything organized.

She was kind enough to welcome me into her space despite my inability to stay longer (though I really wanted to and even daydreamed about renting as a tenant). Her space was extremely homey, the cleanliness and upkeep was subpar. Her communication was both responsive and compassionate. After having a failed attempt with a prior listing due to lack of cleanliness, Dion was able to clarify the cleanliness of her space (which it was!) as well as let me stay for a week to see if I liked it enough. 


I loved it y’all! I really wish I could’ve stayed. This is an amazing space and I wish an abundantly blessed future for this family.

I'm a medical student and was working in the New York area and this spot was perfect for my purposes, especially if you don't mind a commute into the city.

The covers were very comfortable, which made for a good night’s rest. If you are social, sharing bedroom space can be fun. Overall, a pretty mellow experience (in a good way). Great place to come to after you explore the city"

There is a patio that would have been nice in warmer weather.  Several cute restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.  We explored Prospect Park and highly recommend coffee at Relationships! 

Our trip was cut short due to COVID shutting down flights and such but both Vikki and AirBNB were very helpful in refunding a portion of our stay.  Our son lives nearby in Brooklyn so we will definitely return to Vikki's lovely home in the future."

The neighborhood is very quiet as well as the building. One of the neighbors did creep me and my friends out but wasn’t a real bother. It served its purpose for our night, I would book again.

It is in walking distance to the East River, Central Park, many restaurants and grocery stores and really close to the Q line which will take you anywhere that you want to go. 

Before we got there, Zack was a prompt communicator.  We planned to stay for one month, but because of Corona we needed to cut our trip one week short to fly back to Europe before the borders were closed down and were very disappointed that it took Zack a week to respond to our concerns about having to leave early due to the pandemic. 

Not only that but we felt that Zack could have been much more accommodating as a host, turning the heaters on so that the apartment wasn't cold upon arrival, supplying us with more than half a roll of toilet paper and giving us more two bath towels. 

I would not recommend this apartment for long stays."

However, the Host said he would only give me the apartment’s keys if I was wearing mask and gloves. I had to walk around the city with all my suitcases (because I’ve had just arrived in NY) to buy them. When I arrived at the address, he wasn’t even there to check . 
During my entire staying he never went to the apartment. I had the keys of the, but every time I arrived and wanted to get in, the door was closed from the inside. Because the woman that lives there waited me to leave the place to lock it (and she doesn’t speak English). There was this one time that I’ve stayed 30 min on the street yelling her to open the door. 
It wasn’t what I was expecting. It was disappointing."

I chose this place because of the great location and relatively low price compared to other AirBnb options in NYC. I booked for 3 months this time. I ended up leaving 1 and a half weeks before my booking was over due to the spread of Covid 19, which was especially high in that area. We also ran out of Clorox wipes, and when I messaged to request for more, I was told they would be provided soon, but days past and I left before they were ever provided. Overall, I had a pleasant stay. The host was responsive to my messages and resolved some issues I messaged about. However, sometimes responses took a few days, and the host never responded to phone calls."

The floors left my socks black, the freezer had an old milkshake and random pieces on corn in it, there was left over hair from a shave in the bathroom, the tub freaked me out to the point where I didn’t want to shower again, the drain was stuck and the water filled up and I was so disgusted by being in there. The dinner chairs are stained and dirty. Like I stated previously the place is neat but definitely not clean. Not everyone is a clean freak but if you are you’d be bothered by the up-keeping of the home. Then before booking the stay, the rules were very clear on noise and smoking. The rules were fair but the actual people living in the building were very loud and were comfortable smoking marijuana right in front of the building. I’m from NY but if I wasn’t I’d be very disappointed and uncomfortable staying here. "

The gate door code was changed during stay time had to jump the gate and the bathroom had used small amenities like shampoo there was also an issue with smoking Outside the door apparently it was not acceptable out side the house. We are aware of inside of course but outside no, so it gave an issue to resulting in walking around the block during covid19. 
There are other rooms attached to a this apartment so don’t walk around the kitchen freely where there is also a camera in the kitchen. I wouldn’t book again here specifically but it was good for location and they really didn’t bother I had to bother more due to the shower glass moving door , the camera, the door gate, no toiletries as described  the only time they bothered was the no no smoking no where near the house."

Línea de metro 4 y D que te comunica con el centro perfectamente y fácil puesto que yo soy muy tonta para utilizar el tren.

Lots of good food places to try and places to shop. It's also conveniently located close to multiple subway stations.

The place itself is small but comparable to other New York apartments. What you get is very similar to the pictures. There were a few problems such as burnt out lightbulbs and loose door handles but the hosts were very quick to address any issues we had.

It's also worthwhile to note that the laundry is a shared unit in the basement of the building and it does require you to purchase a card ($2 per wash and $2 per dry). The washing machine is on the small side so it takes about 2 loads per wash. The building is old but recently renovated resulting in a nice interior but old heating system. It can get hot when the radiators are on! 

Overall a great experience, a bit expensive but i would definitely recommend!"

The ambiance of the apartment is also welcoming and comforting. I booked last minute and everything was ready and clean upon arrival.

The first day there was a misunderstanding at the beginning regarding the AC not being available because it wasn’t technically summer until the following week, but the host addressed the issue and got it installed within two days. While there was a nice breeze during the day, we couldn’t keep the windows open at night because the street noise is quite loud (understandably) and our toddler wasn’t tolerating it so it became hot without the AC the first couple nights.  One of the outer storm windows was also broken when we got there, which the host was not aware of, but thankfully all the glass fell to the roof on the outside so there were no safety issues.  However, this made me wonder a little about how well the house was actually cleaned since it was very noticeable.  She had someone clean up the broken glass within a couple days as well.  The host was quick to respond to both issues and fixed them timely.  There were plenty of kitchen utensils and the usual stuff needed to cook meals. There was also a grocery store within walking distance.  The outdoor area is very cute and a nice space to have in a city.  It was also shaded most of the day, which was a nice bonus."

when we got to the building, the key wasn’t in the lockbox and we had to wait until someone came out and put it in. we went up to the room and it looked good overall, but we did notice a lot of stains on the floor of the kitchen and bedrooms that looked like they could easily be cleaned. considering the amount of time they had to clean, plus the extra hour, there was no reason why there were easily removable stains on the floor.
also, the door handle to one of the bedrooms and the bathroom would easily come off. the toilet wouldn’t flush all the way and would clog. the dresser in one of the bedrooms looked broken with one of the drawers taped shut.
other than those little things that we noticed, it wasn’t too bad."

The house located about 5 min walk or even less from subway station. Many Asian food places around the station.

And you should know that if you come while cold outside (below +10 Celsius degrees), then you can hear sometimes (per 10-15 minutes) pretty loud sounds of an outside heater (it's noticed in the description). I can fall asleep easily and if you too then it's no problem :)"

It's close to the city, you can be in midtown in about 30 minutes. The train was about 3 minutes walk away which I loved. The neighborhood has a ton of asian and Mexican food, however a bit pricey. Even the bodegas up charge in this area. The guys residing there are also okay, friendly enough.. My biggest issue was that one of them kept coughing. I mean that man coughed my entire 1 month stay with complete disregard for others' well being, coughing all over the place mouth wide open and they rarely aired out the place. Thank God I never got sick in there."

There was some misunderstanding about whether we would come since it was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the cleaning lady cleaned the place, we went to nearby Italian restaurant Saraghina for pizza and drinks (tip: go between 4 and 6 pm for 1/2 price pizza and wine). The place is secure (3 locked doors!) and beautifully decorated. The beds are comfortable and each room is amply heated as needed. We didn't expect to self-isolate and didn't mind not having a TV, but with the restaurants and bars restricted to take-out/delivery, and museums, Broadway shows etc. all closing, we tried to make the best of it by exploring a nearly deserted Brooklyn. Vida was lovely and provided us with Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer and anything else we asked for. She provided us with lots of tips and great suggestions about places to visit, even in these strange times. It's too bad we had to leave earlier than expected. With the city shutting down, it was the right decision. We hope to come back another time soon, to healthy, thriving Brooklyn and stay at Vida's again."

The doormen are fantastic. I felt incredibly safe in the home and in the neighborhood. It is 1 tiny block from an adorable park with tennis courts,  swimming pools, workout area, and playgrounds. 
A few blocks north is a huge park with green space and a big dog park. 
The apartment is next to the East River, which has a gorgeous and safe walk/run path that runs along the river. Beautiful views! 
The neighbors were all quiet and respectful. The home was spacious and had everything I needed! Interior design was perfection. 
Highly recommend!"

Heaters had a horrible sounds and running schedule that you can’t control, very cold or too hot, never in between. Windows are only in the bedrooms and hallway which makes the living room dark and not that nice for working. Light hardly enters the rooms and being so dirty didn’t help. It is an old building so expect things not running properly but otherwise, kitchen was well equiped, LCD with netflix and a sofa to chill in the living room. Bedrooms are big enough for an apartment in Manhattan and comfy. There is just enough place for deposit, hangers and shelves. There is no elevator but that it is not such a big problem. Ending on a positive note, the location and the way you will get the keys of the  apartment will be accurate and fast. I stood 2 months in January-Feb in the apartment so it might be the right choice maybe just for a shorter period in Spring or beginning of autumn when you don’t need the heaters. Hope it helps."

Si bien iba una persona encargada de la limpieza con quien hablé en varias oportunidades y es muy amable. A Funda la vi en tres oportunidades y siempre fue muy amable. Leí comentarios acerca de la casa (que era vieja) y si bien es cierto que no es una casa ""moderna"" ni un hotel cinco estrellas, es acogedora, todo funciona bien, la habitación y la cama eran cómodas. El baño siempre limpio. Y la cocina con todo lo necesario para cocinar. Si tuviera que volver, lo haría sin pensarlo. Lo recomiendo!"

Cons: 
1. Situated directly above a hookah, which blasts loud, bass-y music until 4am Thurs-Sat nights - light (or even medium) sleepers, be forewarned. 
2. Upon arrival, we realized that the supplied address from the host did not exist.  Loaded with bags, we had to reach out to the host to track down the actual address.  Based on this and notes from the host, one could assume that Airbnbs are not allowed in the building.
3. Upon checkout, the host asked us to (Hidden by Airbnb) him for stains on the bathroom wall that were present when we arrived."

Not only is the host is very quick to respond to messages, they were accommodating to my needs when I needed more space in the room. They took out the extra bed before I checked in  so that became my extra storage drawer. Unfortunately I was stuck doing work at home here during covid-19, the desk area in the tiny room is not meant for long work hours.
The area is mainly residential but has a few cool spots within walking distance. The J train I took to work was a 12min walk, and then gets you straight to manhattan.

His apartment is nice (except the couch who has some stains and dirty). The building is very old but it stinks so bad, the smell is out of control. 
The neighbors upstairs are loud (I know it s not the tenant fault) in addition of some pipes that make noises at night, I couldn’t sleep so I had to leave (I sucked it up for as long as I can). And when I asked the tenant about a refund, he tried to give me a speech about “morals and values”, really ??!!"

The spot is sparkling clean and if you like to cook, forget it! The kitchen is packed with everything you’ll need. 
The only issue I ran into was during my check in. I had book a little late that same day and nick wasn’t around to check me in and suggested I waited until 1am for him to come around witch I though it was ridiculous since check in was technically at 4pm and it was 9pm at the time. Anyways, after a talk on the phone Nick came out of his way to facilitate the key to us and checked us in by 11pm with was WAY better then 1am lol 
Nick was a great host over all, very attentive and even gave us extra time to check out and made up for the previous incident. I would definitely book this place again."

He’s super nice, a great conversationalist if you’re up to interacting with him and his roommates, super welcoming, and just all around a spectacular host. I’m so glad I chose this AirBnb; my stay couldn’t have been more perfect. My room was clean, the entire apartment was beautifully decorated by Ignacio, and the outside space was romantic. When I had gotten there, he made me coffee and gave me my silverware, cups, and plates which he had disinfected with soap and alcohol. Claudio and his roommates also have superb taste in music. It really set the mood for a great stay. If you’re considering some place else, HEED TO MY ADVICE! If you want to get a bang for your buck and enjoy a nice, clean, and private stay, there is no need to look any further. I honestly had the time of my life, and I will forever be thankful that Claudio welcomed me into his home. I guarantee that if you book a stay, you will have just as good as an experience as I did, if not better."

There are sound proof windows but this does not cancel out the noise completely. Please also be aware there is no thermostat to alter the temperature. Bring your own fans in the winter - the heat is blasting. Also be prepared for a host that is non-responsive to issues regarding the reservation, he is not very easy to work with resolving issues. I would recommend calling AirBNB for any issues that arise. Great apartment, kind of in a sketchy area, but worth the money for a whole apartment in Brooklyn."

More about the space: tall ceilings, all-day natural light, a sweet European aesthetic and all the amenities I could need. While it is technically a studio, it didn't feel cramped in the least (even after 3 weeks of social distancing)! You can't go wrong with this place."

Jeans place came with all the amenities... it even accommodated with hand sanitizers in each room due to state health issues (coronavirus) right now which I thought was a great touch and super thoughtful! The showers had nice hot water... everything was just lovely ! The place meets the back of the police department so that is a nice reassurance :)   (If you walk out back you can see their offices ). Kinda cool!

"7140","30182137","624400929",2020-05-10,22052253,"Ronn","I spent a month in this apartment to work as an essential NYC health care worker in April. I was surprised how on much I enjoyed the space. At first, the apartment felt a bit small, but it grew and I found it very cozy for just myself. The apartment was clean and the location was great which cut my commute to work to about 5 minutes. Despite the executive order to only allow essential workers and businesses to be open, I found that there was a lot of restaurants and bars (of many different cuisines) were still open- I would have enjoyed all the restaurant  variety if everything was open. There are 5 within grocery stores and markets 3 blocks of the apartment. There is a bus stop around the corner, a Citibike docking station right outside the apartment, and the subway was accessible after a 5 minute walk. 

The apartment was clean. It included a small hallway with a closet, bathroom, kitchen/living area, and a bedroom.

The hallway included several hooks for bags and jackets. The closet had an ironing board, iron, more than enough hangers, extra set of sheets, towels, a small (but powerful) fan, swiffer mop, and a broom. There was also a large garbage can located here.

The bathroom was small, but it was clean and did the job. The hot water in the shower took a few minutes to heat up, but no issues with holding its heat. There is a large mirror with storage plenty enough for my toiletries. It also comes with a plumber, toilet cleaner brush, and hair dryer. There is a steam heating pipe that supplies the building, so sometimes it got warm in the bathroom which didn't bother me.

The kitchen space had some counter space and is equipped with a microwave, fridge, stove, oven, full set of dishware, pots, pans, knife set, cooking utensils (even a can opener and wine opener), measuring cup, drying rack, cutting boards, and garbage bags. The cabinets were spacious and not filled with supplies - which gave me all the space I need to store food items. All I needed was to bring the food, and the kitchen set up allowed me to cook frequently. 

The living space included a couch which can hold 3 people, 4 folding chairs, a table for eating, a coffee table, ceiling light, floor lamp and a rug. There was also a smart TV which I was able to connect to Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, etc. The wifi was strong and reliable. I had no issues. There were two windows here, but I found that I would still have to use the lights - more of a consequence of how NYC apartments are designed. There was an air conditioner which I used a few times on hotter days.

The bedroom was small, but held the full size bed and two small bedside tables. There is space underneath the bed to store items and bags. Underneath the bed, there was a second air conditioner if you needed to put in the bedroom window.

There are several items that you should be prepared for prior to booking this apartment. The 4th floor walk up might be tough for some people, but I did not mind so much- even with a surgical mask on. NYC old apartment walls can be thin, but most of the time neighbors were quiet. Finally, although there is a closet with a lot of hangers in the hallway, the apartment did not have space to include a drawer chest. So storage for clothes is at a premium. I bought a collapsible shelf that hung on the closet rod. 

The space is ideal for a single individual or a couple. I would able to perform any of my daily tasks and work in this apartment. I enjoyed my stay here. If given the opportunity, I would stay here again."

Honestly she is going to teach or help you how to get to the subway station from place to place from another, find the best food, desserts, you name it.

Their home is kept in impeccable condition and it was one of the cleanest places we have ever stayed, including hotels, Air Bnb, or otherwise. They also went the extra mile to ensure we hd ease of parking and could get around easily.

The bedroom was super comfortable too. The shared bathroom was not a let down either. Edna, for the lack of better word is a super host indeed.

Our room was beautiful, spacious, with plenty of storage and a beautiful, private bathroom. Kaz and his team were quick to respond and very helpful when we moved in. When we stayed, the apartment was shared with three foreign exchange students; all very respectful and clean. The apartment is organized to make sure all tenants have equal, designated space in the common areas. There’s a smart TV in the living room and the kitchen is quite large and wonderful. The apartment is located a short, 3-minute walk to the N/W trains. There’s a lovely cafe on the corner and a grocery store just a block away. Everything was very convenient, the neighborhood was wonderful, and we fell in love with Astoria. We couldn’t have asked for a better temporary home and Kaz and his team did everything they could to make our experience as comfortable and wonderful as possible! We are so grateful and would recommend this to anyone looking for a long-term stay in New York!"

When I arrived to the apartment is was a disaster. It was dirty. The kitchen’s counter top was dirty with empty soda and water bottles and food containers. There were dishes in the sink, the room I booked  (room C) I was assigned to was occupied by two naked men. The two men  came out of the room apologized and said they would clean up the room and change out the sheets, because they lived there and knew where everything(cleaning products) was at. I was FURIOUS! I told them no thank you, contacted the “HOST” who I believe was the two men that was having intercourse when I arrived in the room I booked. No response from the host. I then followed up with a phone call to Airbnb. Airbnb returned my call and accommodated with credit towards another Airbnb and reimbursement. PLEASE DON’T BOOK THIS LISTING!"

They also took pictures while I was cooking and sent them to the host as if I left the mess out on the table attempting to send me an additional cleaning fee and threatening to cancel my reservation. 

There is a clean after yourself policy which I am accustomed to bc that is how I was raised however I came into a sink full of dishes food in the stove from who knows when and they had the audacity to try and make me look irresponsible. 

There were ants on my bed and roaches in the bathroom and kitchen. There are no bathroom rugs which will be at the renters expense because I was also faulted for wetting the floor after my shower. 

All while the cohost was acting like everything was great he was going behind and making me look bad to the host."

Being right around the corner from the subway was super convenient, and although the restaurant downstairs does play music late into the night, this was disclosed in the listing and earplugs are provided along with a white noise machine. If you can cope with these things, it's a great find for a stay in the city without having to pay downtown prices. If you are really sensitive to noise, I would definitely think twice about booking.

My experience staying here was very negative. I first made a reservation and realized that this was a 4 bedrooms apartment and that I had to share the bathroom with maybe 5 other guest. Mind you, this is in the middle of a pandemic. That to me was a huge problem specially in this situation we have now with Covid. The host refused to refund me, so I had to cancel that reservation and decided to stay in the other room the week later. The first night, there was lot of noise coming from the other rooms. I could hear people having conversations and laughing until 2 am. I also had to wake up because one of the guests who was staying at one of the other rooms was yelling at her kid for 30 mn because the kid locked them out while they was using the bathroom. Paula was not around and they ddn’t have a phone. I had to call the her myself to help resolve the issue. This particular room was ok but just be aware that you have 3 other rooms im the apartment listed on airbnb and you will be sharing the bathroom with other guests and that is not under the description or “shared spaces”when you booking. It’s not until you book that the host send you a message giving you specifics, which is actually too late because if you cancel, you lose your money. I am a airbnb host myself and I expected a better experience. BE AWARE!"

A 5 minute walk to all the great Hell's Kitchen restaurants and bars on 9th Ave.,  no more than a 10 minute walk to stations for the 1, C/E, N/R/Q trains, and 10-15 minutes walk to pretty much every other train and almost *any* Broadway theatre. The apartment was clean, cozy, and comfortable, with a small kitchen that was well-stocked with the tools to make easy meals when I felt like it or a quick breakfast in the morning. Since there are no windows that face the busy streets outside, the apartment is wonderfully quiet and I had almost no trouble sleeping without earplugs (which is rare for me!). I also tend to sleep very hot, so although I was there at the end of winter and worried about not being able to adjust the building's boiler heat in the apartment, I found that cracking the windows open created the perfect temperature and I slept like a baby most nights. In the bathroom, the rain shower head with additional handheld attachment was a particularly nice, and having a tiled stall made the shower feel much roomier than your standard NYC apartment tub/shower combo. Check-in was a breeze, and although I didn't get to meet Jill in person, her hospitality was some of the best I've ever experienced on Airbnb. The messages I sent with questions before and during my stay were answered lightning-fast, and she was incredibly accommodating to my somewhat unusual travel schedule. This gem is definitely going on my list for future visits if it's available, thank you for a great stay Jill!"

The ONLY disclaimer is the sensitivity of noise control, we fortunately could be out of the space most of the stay but if we had to stay in the apartment longer could have been uncomfortable because of walking on eggshells with the above tenant. Great experience, beautiful space, Ace is a professional and gentleman."
"7430","30848741","618053022",2020-03-14,90685476,"Rosannah","Had a nice stay at Jackson and Christina's apartment.
Although we did have a few issues with certain things.. the exchange of the keys was a little tricky, as we were given the wrong address of where to collect them, from many messages, this was then corrected but just a few hours before arrival so I had no chance of seeing it. This caused a bit of a stress and when I tried to call the number that was given I was put on hold. Eventually retrieved the correct details. 

The apartment was how it was shown in the pictures but slightly more worn in with the cleanliness of the place not quite being up to the standard we had expected esp for the amount we had paid. 

The apartment was on the 1st floor of a very noisy building.
A few nights in a row there were parties being thrown below and I just wish we'd of known this beforehand as I was travelling with my parents who are in their 60's. 

On a good note, towels were left out on each bed and beers left in the fridge were very much appreciated. 

Communcation with Jackson and Christina was great and they were very helpful with any queries we may of had and did give us a list of ideas of places to visit/eat/see etc. So there was no fault there! 

I wanted this review to be honest and as helpful as possible for other guests looking to stay in the future and I really don't mean any disrespect to you guys as you were very kind throughout the stay. 

Thank you,

Rosannah and Family :)"

When I first arrived the smell was faint like someone had recently used the bathroom but later on it got stronger and stronger even with  the fan on it didn't help I just kept the door cracked and the window opened,I keep air freshener in my travel bag so that was okay but it didn't cover the smell completely just for a while. The bed is not as comfortable as it looks and the sheets kept coming off. However, the amenities were amazing I bought pretty much everything I needed so I didn't use much of what was provided but greatly I appreciated it.

Nous étions une famille avec un enfant de deux ans et sommes restés 5 semaines dans l’appartement qui était très bien. Julian est vraiment un excellent hôte, hyper arrangeant, hyper réactif tout en restant discret. L’appartement est propre grâce à une femme de ménage qui passe chaque semaine nettoyer la cuisine, la salle de bain et changer les draps et serviettes.
L’appartement est situé dans Astoria, très proche d’une station de métro ou à une demi-heure d’un arrêt de ferry (attention, la Metrocard ne fonctionne pas mais le prix du trajet est de 2,75 dollars) ! J’allais tous les jours au Metropolitan Museum en 30 à 40 min. Le quartier ne craint pas du tout et il y a tout à proximité (restau, bars, supermarchés, laundromat etc.). Nous nous sommes toujours sentis en totale sécurité (comme le reste de New-York par ailleurs).
Nous n’avons pas du tout souffert du bruit, peut-être parce que nous dormions côté cour mais il nous semble que même côté rue, le bruit n’est pas gênant outre mesure (pourtant nous vivons à la campagne en France donc sommes peu habitués aux bruits de la rue).
La literie était excellente et l’appartement avait absolument tous les ustensiles utiles pour faire la cuisine.
Nous sommes arrivés en plein hiver, il faisait -8 degrés et nous n’avons pas du tout eu froid dans l’appartement (au contraire !) malgré le fait que ce soit une maison assez ancienne et le petit chauffage (qui cache un réseau de tuyaux qui chauffent bien l’appartement).
En bref, nous recommandons ce logement, même pour un séjour longue durée et dans un contexte professionnel (et même avec un enfant qui reste un peu plus dans l’appartement).

 Excellent apartment, excellent value for money for this apartment with two bedrooms and their adjoining living rooms, a large kitchen and a bathroom, in a real house.
We were a family with a two year old child and stayed in the apartment for 5 weeks which was very good. Julian is really an excellent host, hyper accommodating, hyper reactive while remaining discreet. The apartment is clean thanks to a cleaning lady who comes every week to clean the kitchen, the bathroom and change the sheets and towels.
The apartment is located in Astoria, very close to a metro station or half an hour from a ferry stop (note, the Metrocard does not work but the cost of the journey is only 2.75 dollars)! I went to the Metropolitan Museum every day in 30 to 40 minutes. The neighborhood does not fear at all and there is everything nearby (restaurant, bars, supermarkets, laundromat etc.). We have always felt completely safe (like the rest of New York by the way).
We did not suffer from the noise at all, perhaps because we slept on the courtyard side but it seems to us that even on the street side, the noise is not disturbing beyond measure (however we live in the countryside in France so are few accustomed to street noise).
The bedding was excellent and the apartment had absolutely all the utensils useful for cooking.
We arrived in the middle of winter, it was -8 degrees out and we were not at all cold in the apartment (on the contrary!) despite the fact that it is a fairly old house and the small heating (which hides a network pipes that heat the apartment well).
In short, we recommend this accommodation, even for a long stay and in a professional context (and even with a child who stays a little longer in the apartment)."

Not only was it ideally located in the Village between two convenient subway stops, but the apartment and building were both outstanding.  The building was quiet:  no loud noises in the hall or sounds coming through the walls, floors, or ceiling.  Plus, the unit faces back, not onto the street.  It is not dark, though, since the area in the back is garden space for the surrounding buildings.  As others pointed out, there was some construction going on, but it was never noisy at an inappropriate time of day.  The apartment, itself, was immaculate and exactly as pictured in the AirBnB profile.  There was plenty of space for the three of us.  I slept on the sofabed, which was easy to pull out and put back, and comfortable!  Check-in was seamless, and Alex quickly replied to messages.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Recommend!!"

I was disappointed when I tried to extend my stay for a week and the host wanted to increase the rate when there were no other bookings. I felt like the host was trying to take advantage of me. Because I wanted the convenience of staying in the same place, I extended my stay outside of air bnb at a higher rate.
 
I was also disappointed with the cleanliness. I found dust balls, hair and food crumbs in various places. 
And, as other reviewers mentioned, I also had issues with the WiFi and air conditioner did not work well.

Pros: The apartment is conveniently located in Hell’s Kitchen on a street normally lined with open bars and restaurants. Also it’s nice that there are two bedrooms and bathrooms. The lighting is also nice and bright and the full length mirrors are convenient."

The bathroom is separated from the main room with the French doors and a curtain so it is not the same amount of privacy that you may expect from the bathroom. On the other hand the huge bathtub was amazing to warm up and relax in. 
Thanks again, we are definitely recommend this place anyone passing through."

From the very first conversation between Eric and I there was honest and prompt communication and a sincere desire to help and accommodate me in every way. I have a small dog and she was very happy and liked Eric and Amber very much. Animals have a 6th sense about people, and I trust her instincts. The neighborhood is lovely, there’s a wonderful park (off leash hours for dogs!) across the street. Great food choices, and very quiet at night. I’d recommend this lovely apartment to everyone."

I have previously stayed at Kaz’s other accommodations as well and like this one they are all clean and the interiors are well planned. I loved the size of the room and having a study lamp and desk was perfect. They have a very responsive maintenance team that responds within a few minutes for any help one needs. The only downside of this place is it’s proximity to the 7 train track which is also a huge bonus if you won’t be spending much time in the room since the 61st Woodside station is just a 5 minute walk. Will definitely be staying with kaz on my future visits to New York."

The roommates were very respectful and kind to us.

I began to try establish communication with the host but simply lack of response or care as to what I wanted as a guest. Modupe does not treat her guest with respect. My bed was at least 20 years old. Dirty sheets pee stains on the bed. It was as if I was staying in a room of a recent family member was deceased. She’s incompetent ,inconsistent, and inconsiderate. All her guest make noise at odd times through out the night including her. The room was just unsanitary didn’t feel right. Also host watches every move like as if im a child. Every time I leave to the store she questions me if I leave to see my mother or my wife I’m being questioned, she definitely has some nerve. I don’t recommend anyone to stay there. Horrible experience by far the worst stay I’ve ever experienced in my 3 years of air bnb."

My family and I have stayed at her place for quite a long period of time during the terrible pandemic this year. However, as they say tough times reveal your real character, Luba and her family members were genuine people. She was always very nice and caring that we very quickly felt like she's already becoming a part of our family.
Luba's response time is quite fast and her instructions are crystal clear.
The place was absolutely spacious, clean and very well furnished and equipped, just as advertised!
It is located in a very safe neighborhood and it is literally a few minutes walking distance from  restaurants, convenient stores, healthcare centers, parks, playgrounds, lounges, bars and the metro station.
It is just the perfect place for a family with or without kids and could also be great for friends traveling together.
Since this was not my first visit to New York; I consider this place by far the best place that I stayed in and I would definitely stay here again in my future visits as it is definitely somewhere you want to stay, and hate when you have to leave.
Thank you Luba for making our stay at your place remarkable and unforgettable."

Key pick up went fairly smoothly, but requires you to pick up from a station installed in a deli nearby, which is convenient but slightly awkward. The space itself is cozy - a bit smaller than it appears in the pictures but well-sized for New York. But all of this is fairly standard in New York - I would definitely recommend this space for a future stay"

The artwork and plants all around the place give it a cool touch. The beds were comfortable. Washer & dryer is a plus. There are a few things I want to point out. Towels were provided but washcloths were not. There isn’t a microwave so be prepared to either use the stove or oven for reheating food. This would not be ideal for an elderly person or anyone with a physical disability as there are about 12 flights of 5 stairs each you need to walk up to get to the apartment. And the shower head flow is not centered. There are convenience stores at each corner and it wasn’t difficult to find street parking. Peter accommodated us last minute which was greatly appreciated.

Being a Floridian the space didn't have A.C. my first day there; the host made sure to accommodate our room and an A.C. unit was put in the next day. Highly recommend this space to every one. Also its totally private, no one to bother you, or come in and out. They will check up on you via message to make sure everything okay, or if you'd like anything.

El supermercado keyfood estaba al lado, lo que lo hacía muy conveniente para comprar agua, comida más barata.
Quizás lo que podría mejorar es mantener un poco más limpia la habitación antes de la llegada ya que aún quedaban cosas de otros huéspedes como medicina, calcetines, etc,  pero a pesar de esto yo le doy 5 estrellas y lo recomiendo.

Jerome and his co-host were super helpful and very quickly responsive. The place was incredibly clean and nicely decorated. 

I did have a slight issue with my essential oil diffuser setting off the smoke alarm, but I think that just speaks to the high level of safety of the apartment if nothing else.

"7757","31543246","622472177",2020-04-15,157159,"Asha","I rented the apartment for months.  PROS: Great location.  Two blocks from Whole Foods, great restaurants, and 2/3 subway station.  Spacious one-bedroom apartment, especially for Manhattan.  Lots of closet space.  Comfortable bed. All the basic essentials for a long-term stay.  CONS: 1.) The entire apartment would often smell like weed since it sits on the top floor and there's central air, so weed smoke coming from bottom floors would rise to the top. 2.) The buzzer doesn't work, and it's not labeled.  UPS and FedEx delivery men often don't have keys to the brownstone, so it was difficult getting packages delivered.  It was frustrating when UPS or FedEx would deliver my packages while I'm home in the apartment, but because they had no way of contacting me or accessing the building, they would just leave with my packages. 3. The host Romeo is nice but not always very responsive.  I made a few requests which he said he would  do but never did. 4.) Wifi is weak in the bedroom."

With every gadget that you may need to fix a full course meal. The bathroom is French luxury in my opinion. Gabrielle and her husband were very kind and communicated well with me. Given the circumstances that I was in NYC as a travel nurse it felt great to have a touch of home with the large spaces and private outdoor space. So many grocery stores and shops in the immediate area. Everything is almost in walking distance. Finishing my shift at 11pm most times I felt extremely safe in the well lit clean neighborhood."

From day one, both Karen and Scott could not do enough to make our stay anymore comfortable. The room was cosy and clean and had extra supplies of toiletries if needed. From genuinely helpful tourist related information to assisting us with our business.
  
After two weeks of our six week stay we were forced to leave early due to the outbreak of Covid-19. 
Although we were forced to stay indoors for our last week, we were lucky enough to enjoy movie nights with Karen and Scott while munching through popcorn! 

Karen went above and beyond and drove us to the airport as well as refunding our stay. If there was an option for Super Super Host, Karen and Scott would get it!

We arrived as guests but left as friends and we look forward to seeing them when the world as we know it, is back to normal "

If you love bird watching just look out the side windows everyday and see the numerous colored Cardinals. The back yard is facing  a beautiful  tranquil park that has many benches the sit or just walk around.  The home is a couple of blocks away from  a beautiful lake and park.  Overall it was our most amazing stay in an Airbnb.  Cherokee, our host was just a phone call away and very responsive to any needs.  We look forward to staying there again when back in NY."

The decoration is really simple yet doesn't require more. The flat has all  amenities you'd need for a short stay, and the bed is the best one we've ever slept in (on top of being huuge).
Metro station is not even 10min walk and then you're in Manhattan in +/- 40min. There's a grocery store right across the corner as well as a great Italian restaurant. 

The bar next door is also pretty nice (concert) and although the bedroom shares a wall with it, noise is not even close to be an issue despite of what we've read in the comments prior to our stay.
We would recommend the apartment to everyone staying in New York for a week or less, just perfect!"

Bethany place provided the perfect “quarantine and chill” for my family. We even extended our original 3 days to 6 days . The bed and the decor was to die for. The kitchen was clean  with all the amenities and the tub was wonderful. I enjoyed that more then the bed. I soaked in there for 2 hours . My toddler enjoyed the space to run about in a safe clean environment. There were no sharp objects to worry about which is always a plus when dealing with babies. The housekeeper Luz came in and even cleaned for us. She was friendly and efficient. Bethany herself is a pleasurable host. She may take sometime to respond but her mom is available as well. We only spoke when we needed to extend our stay and she was very pleasant and understanding when it came to that matter. Bethany place is one of Bed Stuy’s best kept secrets. I’ll definitely be back again and again . Thank you Bethany."

The apartment was decently spacious (the bedrooms are quite large compared to many other apartments in the city) but there were a few concerns I had, mainly surrounding the overall cleanliness of the apartment. The ceiling fans were caked with dust that flew everywhere when they were turned on, and many of the pillows were stained which was a bit gross. The toilet was also quite dirty and had clearly not been scrubbed prior to our arrival. The blinds in one of the bedrooms were also falling apart and couldn't be opened/closed fully. A number of the light fixtures were also missing light bulbs which makes it quite dark inside as there are no windows into the living room. 

My complains with the apartment are mainly simple things that could be easily and inexpensively fixed by the owner to make this a relatively flawless stay. The location of the apartment is great, you're very close to the 33rd street 6 station and there's lots of restaurants and a gym in walking distance. This unit is on the 3rd floor and very easy to get up to, and the building is very quiet (we were never there during work hours on weekdays though). Overall it was an okay place to stay for the winter, and could easily be made into a 5 star stay with some simple fixes."

Nosotros eramos 7, fuimos con un bebé y tuvimos todo lo que necesitamos. Hay que tener en cuenta que hay que subir escaleras para acceder a las habitaciones de arriba por si alguien tiene dificultades para ello.  Es un barrio aparentemente tranquilo. Si vas a estar varios días por NY se te puede hacer pesado el recorrido en metro hasta Manhattan ya que son 40 minutos; pero si estás acostumbrado a este tipo de trayectos es totalmente directo y la estación está muy cerca."

If you like to walk (as we do), taking 30 minutes to walk over Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan is wonderful. 

The apartment itself is perfect. Very spacious for four travellers, great amenities and homey decor. High ceilings and room to kick back and relax. It's an AirBnb that you're simply relieved to arrive at after long travels - I think that's the best way to describe it.

Check-in was very smooth and it introduces you to the great deli on the corner, which has everything you need for a pre-dinner-snack or your morning coffee. Try their everything bagels, they are great.

Tip: If you're tired on your first night and still feel like going for a good meal and drinks, book a table at Maison Premiere which is more or less across the street. They have great service, great food and provide a gorgeous space for first night out.

Thanks to Diego for being a wonderful host, quick to reply and very kind when we had to leave quickly and prematurely (We were called home because of COVID-19 - all Danes abroad were called home March 2020). 

When we return to New York, Diego's place will be our first choice to stay and we can't wait to be back there!"

It is always warm. The bathroom is inside the room. Kaz and Kayo were always reachable and kind.

First I booked a room at different listing and as soon as I get a confirmation the host calls me to say it's a double booking. The host offered another room the same price and being that it was 9pm I agreed. Upon arrival, the door gate code was incorrect. The keys were no where to be found, so I had to wait for someone to let me in. The room they offered me was already occupied so I had to settle for a smaller room with no windows. The room was smelly and dirty. The bathroom had blood on the toilet. The kitchen was filled with dishes and flies. I left the very next morning and contacted the host and got no reply. I wouldn't recommend booking with this host for any listings."

His stylish accommodations were first-class, with all the amenities you would expect of a luxury condominium in an elevator building: design-centric and comfortable furnishings, plenty of natural light, plush bedding, a full-service kitchen, a washer-dryer, and a dishwasher (making cleanup a breeze).

Close to Greenwich Village and Noho, the central location cannot be understated and is an easy walk or Citibike ride to popular destinations like Wall Street, the World Trade Center, the Theater District, Times Square, and Central Park. Luckily, Levain is a block away, letting you snag a coffee and cookie along the way.

It almost goes without saying, but, in the midst of a pandemic, Brett's place provided a clean and quiet retreat. Highest recommendation."

It's quite roomy for a two bedroom apartment. It was really nice to come back to a clean apartment after going out. Since this stay was in mid-March, we ended up staying in more than anticipated since the city declared a state of emergency for COVID-19. My only complaint is the space heaters could be replaced since they didn't emit much heat. And the shower was a bit on the narrow side. Also, if the neighbors upstairs were home, the walking sounded like stomping so that was not fun to deal with while trying to relax at home."

The bedroom is a dream, the bed is so comfortable, the space is charming, and the light it gets is insane! Everything was super clean and there were nice touches like a fresh daisy and house instructions printed on pretty paper to welcome me. The backyard is gorgeous, feels secluded, and is a great way to have morning (or afternoon, or whenever) coffee. 
The other great part is that this is a pet friendly spot so my kitty could stay and enjoy the fenced in outdoors. And also - my cat does not like other animals and usually has an issue with lingering scent in new places - but here there was no trace of their scent, which means Pam doesn't just clean, she CLEANS! So I'm sure pet allergy sufferers would have no issue here!
Pam was incredibly responsive and made me feel like the most important person in the world while I was staying there. Like I had an invisible little support team there for whatever I needed."

Si bien no es tan cerca del centro de Manhattan es muy cómodo llegar en metro o colectivos, no tuvimos ningún problema incluso cuando volvimos por la noche. El barrio parece muy seguro, hay almacenes abiertos hasta tarde para realizar  compras y siempre anda gente. 
Pero lo mejor son Arnol y Ruben que te hacen sentir en casa, son muy cálidos, te ayudan en todo lo que necesites, siempre están bien predispuestos ya sea en persona o por teléfono, te dan indicaciones (Y Ruben clases de historia también jaja). Arnol nos ha deleitado con sus platos y sus desayunos.

However! the space ended up being comfortable, functional, and clean. We really enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen, and it was great to have tons of light in the living space from the skylight. There were two good-sized bathrooms and lots of extra towels. The beds were comfortable memory foam mattresses, and all were a good size with good (and plentiful) pillows. It’s also very well-located in the heart of Williamsburg with a grocery store a block away, a citi bike station less than a block away, and spectacular restaurants such as Montesacro and Dough Vale within a few blocks. 

The thing I need to mention was that we didn’t have WiFi, and there were issues with the hot water being slow to get hot, the thermostat being broken, and the freezer being frosted over and not shutting. Roman responded about these things relatively quickly, but was slow to get it resolved (it took 5 days to get WiFi, and we fixed the other issues ourselves). It seemed like there was never WiFi in the apartment in the first place, since we ended up having to let a tech in for an appointment to set it up from scratch. Obviously it’s now set up for future guests, but other issues may be similarly difficult to get resolved as it seems he is busy and does not live in NYC at least part of the time."

The first night we stayed there the neighbors were very loud and the staff didn’t not deal with them accordingly when we contacted the staff multiple times about the noise and they didn’t d nothing about it. We had to relocate to a different room.  Incompetent staff, didn’t know which facilities were open to use. Told us the grill was not working when we dither people using it.  As experience in general, will not go back there again."

The room was mostly clean, but they could have done a little better job. It just looked like the room hasn’t been touched in a while. Food/drinks available in the lobby and friendly staff. If you drive, expect extra fees. $70 valet, or I recommend the parking garage next door. Note that on check in they charge your card an additional $85 as a security deposit. On check out, they take $40 and give you back $45 assuming there are no issues with the room."

I only received 40.00 back after checking out. I asked what seemed to be the problem, and the lady at the front desk told me to wait until Friday to see if my money would be returned to me in full. It’s been almost a month and the money is not in my account and they refuse to return my phone calls. The listing stated many restaurants would be open for delivery considering the times we are in. But most of the restaurants in fact weren’t even responsive to the phone calls made by the hotel. If the whole price (no extra or hidden fees) were included on the listing itself I wouldn’t have been as upset with my stay because I knew what I was paying for. And if the room I paid almost 200.00 dollars for, for ONE nights, actually looked like what the photos showed, that would’ve mad it better as well. Very MISLEADING."

My TV wasn’t working on the first day I was there. I told the front desk and even texted them. Twice I was told maintenance was coming to fix it but no one ever came. I don’t watch much TV so it wasn’t that much of an inconvenience to me. However, I expect things to work properly when I book a room at a hotel. 

I booked through AirBnB and was charged the amount quoted via AirBnB. A few days later I was charged an additional couple hundred dollars for “taxes”. This was my second time staying there through AirBnB and the previous time I wasn’t charged an additional fee for so called taxes. Just be prepared to pay twice as much as you’re quoted from AirBnB..."

The hotel acted as if they didn’t know what air bnb was when I was trying check in, they also needed a 50 dollar security deposit ( no apple pay was accepted which was the only thing I had at the time) , then when a 53.97 charge in taxes  ( which they also needed a card ) . When I lifted up the white sheet to see the mattress , the mattress cover was stained. I honestly wouldn’t recommend staying here. I’ve stayed at many other air bnbs so I know this isn’t the norm with the app because for 183.97 ( yes the first 50 was returned) you could pretty much book an entire house in the city thats like a decent 15 minutes train ride away for 2.75 which is what i’ll be doing from now on. Extremely disappointed!!"

I stayed here for a few months and I enjoyed it very much. It is conveniently next to a 24/7 grocery store, a short walk to 2 major trains and near a bunch of restaurants. The place had great amenities and was kept very clean. Be prepared to stay with roommates, because this place has 6 bedrooms and also this apartment is in the basement so it can get a little chilly during the winter so bring layers! Overall this was a 5 star stay and I would book again! :)"

Overall, my friends were happy to stay at this place for this price and quality! 
Thanks a lot!"

"8302","32770241","620532401",2020-03-22,105616197,"Benita","Hi! 
I was staying at this apartment/room for almost 6 months (end of September till end of March). I would like to group this evaluation in different categories: 

1) the room 
The room was circa 3,5m x 5m big, had 3 windows (direct sunlight in the morning between 10 and 11.30am - the view was mostly just other buildings nearby), a queen size bed (1,5m x 2m - was okay, not uncomfortable but also not the most comfortable bed), a table, a chair and a built-in-the-wall-closet (mostly to hang clothes) with a door (but only half of the closet could be closed by the door). The pictures also showed That there would be shelves - unfortunately they must have been removed before I moved in, but I am sure, that if I had asked for shelves they/Kaz would have brought some. 
Unfortunately I couldn’t really lock my room door from the outside (only from the inside) but Kaz provided a little safe. 

2) the Apartment 
The apartment has 4 bedrooms (so it was  3 roommates + me), a living room (sofa + TV with Netflix but no cable), kitchen and bathroom. 
The kitchen was fully equipped with everything one would need to cook or bake. Unfortunately the roommates were not always very clean (although everyone cleaned the supplies after using), so I didn’t enjoy cooking in that kitchen. 
Everyone is assigned some space in the fridge and the kitchen closets.
The bathroom was okay (also cleanliness of the roommates is a huge factor and I was living with 3 guys), let’s say I tried to touch not too much in the bathroom most of the time. 
Once a week a cleaning lady would clean the kitchen and bathroom. 
I met my roommates sometimes in the kitchen, but we didn’t hang out - there was no community. 
There is no washing machine.

3) communication with Kaz 
The communication with Kaz was great, he or one of his employees answered very quickly (usually within minutes). Also when I asked to extend my stay or change the check out time - no problem at all. 
When I asked for an iron, someone brought one by the next day. 
Really great service 

4) other stuff about the room
Heating: In New York heating is regulated by a central organization, so I didn’t have any control over the heater. It depends on the temperature outside, so it only was heating when it was really cold outside, so in general I was more likely to be freezing in my room than being warm. That was unfortunate but no one could help change that. I also had the feeling that the windows were not isolating. 

Toilet paper was supplied by Kaz. 

5) location 
The nearest subway station is 52nd street (7 line) - about 7/8 minutes to get there. Also Northern Boulevard (15 minutes - M and R trains, sometimes E train) was available. 
I usually took the 7 train, it takes in total about 20-25 minutes to get to Grand Central from the apartment. 
The subway connection was really good (usually I needed to change subways one time, but hey - you’re in New York and it’s huge!!). Most of the time it took me about 45 minutes to get to my meeting point in Manhattan. 
The apartment is located between Sunnyside and Woodside. 
4/5 minutes from the apartment you can find: supermarket, nail salon, hairdresser, several restaurants, washing salons, gym (blink fitness!), pharmacy etc. 
it’s a lively neighborhood and I felt completely safe. 
It was quite at night (except for when the fire department had to head out) and also not very noisy at night. 
The apartment is in a 2-floor-house on the second floor. 

All in all I was content with my room and the location. Of course there were things bothering me (cleanliness or the warmth of my room), but those were things that Kaz couldn’t change. 
I can recommend staying at this apartment if you’re looking for a room for a few months."

"8305","32784434","624935114",2020-05-16,92206728,"Eboni","I recommend this listing.  The location is great - while I did visit during the pandemic, the apartment is on the street and still very quiet.  If you hop on over to the next avenue, you can basically look up and down Manhattan. The apartment itself is even more spacious than the photo might suggest - although I just stayed with a small child, I think several adults could comfortably fit here.  Toiletries, cleaning items,  lots of fresh towels, etc. were available for my stay, making it feel like I was at home. And of course, Anna herself was very kind - I happened to meet her when I checked in and she kindly greeted me, gave me instructions, and made herself available for any additional questions. I appreciate it."

Hiroki and his team were amazing and super nice. 
However what ruined the stay was the racist nasty old black lady staying there. We even complained to hiroki about it and never heard back. There is a rude and racist piece of shit staying here who would bang doors super loud and act childish. She would even yell derogatory Names at my  roommate and I such as “dirty brown pigs” and “scums”. She would blame us for leaving dishes in the sink that we’re not ours. There were 4 other people residing there and she didn’t seem to have a problem with them. Fucking racist bitch. Then she would use my dishes and sandals even though she’s unsanitary and fucking gross. The bathroom in the house leaks and it’s so hard to take a shower. There was no hand soap Or toilet paper or dish soap, all we had to buy our own. My friends food was thrown out and no one confessed to stealing it but it was probably the old nasty black Lady staying there who made racist remarks against my Mexican friend And me, an Indian woman."

The place itself was beautiful and clean. However Laureatas (Host) manner of communication wasn't the best. Please note the property is on a Street although it says Avenue on the door. The studio had A LOT Of NOISE from someone stumping accross the roof, going up and down the stair, baby crying, dog barking, noise from the pipes. I found it almost impossible to take naps during the day as i could hear EVERYTHING from inside the studio. BRING YOUR OWN TOILET PAPER as host mentioned they are not mandated by airbnb to provide it due to shortage in store at this time. I stayed for 12 DAYS and ran of Toilet of paper half way thru my stay."

The apartment itself is very clean. The rooms are spacious. Comfortable beds. Clean linen. Good natural lighting. The overall vibe of the apartment is super comfortable and reminds me of being in my own home. The host, tiya, was incredible making sure that I had anything I needed and available to answer any questions. She was communicable and easy to talk too; I felt like I was talking to a close friend. (Hopefully a new friend.)The neighborhood is lovely and diverse with tons of shops, bars, etc. Anything you can think of, you can find within a 20 min walk. Subway stations are within a 10-15 min walk. Buses are even closer. I would recommend staying at David’s Place to anyone and I myself would stay again. It was much better than I expected!"

The bedroom is a little small, but there is the option to use the main living area to sleep in as well. Super spacious as a loft over all and the kitchen is really equipped.

There is also a conveniently located grocery store in basically the same building around the corner, which was handy. The bathroom was super clean and functional.

There is no microwave or dish washer, but that is kind of a part of the old school charm about the place. 

The smoke alarm did go of a few times because my weak self could not open the windows, but the spot was well equipped and was a little peaceful Havana for a creative like myself."

"8395","32922087","620536615",2020-03-22,54487744,"Fabiola","To start , the location is perfect . Right in the middle of Washington Heights , accessible to everything you need. The subway is about a 3-4 min walk from there you can catch the A express all the way down to Time Square . You honestly don’t need a car coming to New York unless you plan on driving farther . Maybe it’s just me but New York Subways are so convenient, the transfers are great too . 

The home is as pictured , the  room is in the basement but once you’re inside and settled it’s lovely . It was a very comfortable stay , although the bedroom could have been cleaner. I could tell the bedsheets probably hadn’t been changed and the floor had a lot of small trash . The bathroom was clean , but every time I took a shower it was cold lol not complaining though it was kind of refreshing. Towels were provided as well . 

One thing that definitely sucked throughout my stay was the LOUD BANGING SOUND that kept on from midnight - the morning !!! Omg it drove me crazy , Noise doesn’t usually affect me while I sleep but this was overboard. I don’t know if it was the heater cutting on throughout the building or just someone literally banging on a pipe for 3 days straight , but that should probably get fixed .


Overall the home was great for a short stay and the small touches such as pictures of their family and souvenirs from other states made it feel very comfortable . A few flaws but if fixed would definitely stay here again ."

You are near the A/C B/D if you don't mind the extra 2 block walk.  The 2/3 is a 5 min walk. The 4/5/6 is about a 10 min walk.  Whole Foods and another Organic grocer are near by for those who eat healthy like myself.  I've always liked Harlem and this accommodation sits in the heart of its culture.  This Airbnb is within a secure coded building, the gym, laundry, and rooftop are perfect bonuses along with the balcony off the room.  The hosts are friendly and I am sure you will feel right at home here.  I hope you choose this one.  I am sure glad I did."

He was very accommodating and helped me with anything I needed. He showed me where the shops were and other important places like the laundrette and where the train station was. He also gave me his recommendations on good places to eat (take out and had the leaflets for the numbers). And bought me my first gallon of water (drinking water). He was also very respectful of my privacy and made me feel comfortable which is so thing you don’t always get as a solo female traveller. 

Location: Honestly so close to the city, the train station is really near by so it was really conviennent. Also the Yankee stadium was only a couple stops away too, if you’re into that. The streets are always well lit so you don’t step out into darkness if you go out at night. 

Other things to mention: The TV was great! Big and you could connect Netflix to it. The WiFi was always fast. Also Ligel’s  responses were always fast. 

10/10 would definitely stay there again if I find myself in NYC!! It makes sense why he is a super host."

If you are someone who needs sunlight and wants a view, this is not the place. The windows face barbed wire, trash covered alleys and cement walls.
Heating and cooling is going to be handled by fans, window ac units and space heaters.
There are 2 bathrooms. One with 2 sinks, the other with one. Both were fine (the sinks are strong though, watch not to turn them too high).
There is in unit laundry, just be aware that the dryer is very very weak and will take several hours for a load.
The apartment is a basement apartment, so you enter through a side gate and enter through a storage area to get to the door. You are right next to the supers office. In order to get mail or dispose of trash, you will need to go up to the main entrance lobby.

Bedroom layouts are as follows:
Bedroom 1: No window, no closet, no dresser
Bedroom 2: No window, closet, no dresser, door is glass with curtains to provide privacy
Bedroom 3: Window with AC unit, closet, dresser
Bedroom 4: Window with AC unit, closet, dresser

All in all, it was fine for the 4 months we stayed here."

The ride with the train isn‘t the shortest but we got used to it after a while.

Edgar was always friendly and he was there for us, when we had questions. Also regarding the current situation in the world, he was calm and cleaned everything even more.

If we ever come back to NYC we would always stay with Edgar again, I absolutely recommend this BnB "

Communication with this host is better via What’s App.  The response took longer via the App.   A recommendation would be to bring your own paper towels being that we have to wash our hands so much in this pandemic.  They didn’t have any.  The WiFi went out the second day but I didn’t complain to the host I just used my hotspot.   Last I would highly stress to bring your own towel and wash clothes.  Especially if if it’s going to be multiple guest.   It was only one towel.   The location is wonderful.  Right on the bus stop if you would like to travel downtown.  It is parking in the area but the later it is the harder parking is hard to find but it’s free.  The place is newly renovated and the access is simple as 123.   There is no TV so bring your own entertainment.  There’s no dressers to store your clothes but a closet to hang them and space for a suitcase or two.  As a single occupant it was wonderful and even for couples it will be a comfortable stay.  
I would definitely stay there again."

Otherwise, it's clean, safe, has laundry facilities downstairs (expensive, but hey, it's NYC!), and is an extremely convenient location. It was great to be close to work, close to bike stations, close to grocery stores (there's a Target with groceries close by, a dollar store, and Asian store, and a Trader Joe's less than a mile away).

(It’s NYC) The grill pictured in the photos (which was a major reason I booked the place) was not available for use which made the food my guest and I brought for grilling stove food. My guest and I were tanning in the yard in our bathing suits and the host decided to water the grass and asked us to go inside because we were wearing bathing suits and and her male counterpart was coming to the yard which was very off putting.

Everything you need is within walking distance and Prospect Park is just up the hill. The apartment is close to a number of subway stops that will get you quickly to downtown Brooklyn or Manhattan.

We enjoyed the stay at Regina’s place, it is cosy and comfortable, with a view of Manhattan. The hosts quickly responded to our requests and were very helpful.

A very vivid place, conveniently located near the subway station,  just 10 min to the NYC center. The abundance of family restaurants, grocery stores and haircut places reminded me of Lisbon.

Then I went into bathroom and the bathroom was not clean. There wasn’t any rooms available so I stayed and was told I would get a room clean . Then when morning shift came I was told that’s not the case. So I was moved into a new room . It was better than the first but when I heard knocking I went to look through peep hole a water bug came out. I was disappointed overall and expected better because of the pictures .

All the living necessities are provided, such as toilet papers, towels, dishwasher detergent, salt, olive oil, dishes, etc. all of these make you feel like staying at home. 

The only inconvenience is that there is no washing machine or dryer in the room. You have to go downstairs and use the building’s facilities. 

In terms of the location, it is perfect. Walking distance to Times Square and broadway shows. A lot of restaurants nearby since it’s in Hell’s Kitchen. 

The Sonder agents are nice to communicate. They responded fast and solved problems quickly.

Overall, I would highly recommend this 1br."

We were graciously welcomed by Nadine and were given a tour of the space. As if we weren’t blown away by the beautifully appointed interiors she surprised us with a bottle of bubbles and a card for our celebratory stay. 

If you’re unfamiliar with Astoria, don’t fret as she has thought of it all. From MetroCards to recommendations of local eateries and activities, you’ll have information at your fingertips provided by one of the most thoughtful hosts. 

As a hospitality professional, Nadine’s level of hospitality is matched by those of many five star properties around the world. So, if you’re looking for a place to stay during an upcoming trip to NYC, give Astoria and Nadine’s a try. With easy accessibility to the city and a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city, you won’t be disappointed with a stay at Nadine’s in Astoria."

The heavenly bed is very comfortable, the spotless bathroom has bath gel, shampoo, fresh towels (just like in a hotel), the living area is a superb place to relax, the kitchen is well-stocked if you need to cook.

Check-in was easy & Sue took the time to show me all features of the apartment & building, including the laundry area.   She kept in touch throughout my stay & was most hospitable.

For anyone wishing to stay in the Midtown East/Grand Central/U.N.  area - the location of the building cannot be beat.   It’s nestled on a safe, quiet block within steps of a large, 24-hour CVS  & a gourmet deli.  There’s a 24 hour doorman and 2 efficient elevators & the building is well-maintained.  

The apt. is a 2nd floor end unit & having lived in several Manhattan apts. in earlier years & stayed in many hotels —it was the most quiet setting I’ve yet experienced.   I travel with a noise diffuser yet it wasn’t needed at all.  The neighbors are polite and friendly, as are the doormen.  

By Manhattan standards, the apt. is generously sized.  There’s good separation/privacy between the 2 bedrooms.  Though I only used the front bedroom, the bed was exceptionally comfortable & had a new mattress.   The kitchen was quite adequate for cooking/dining-in purposes — equipped w/ coffeemaker, blender, microwave & multiple cooking ware.  The bathroom waa modern, with bright lighting & good water pressure. A pleasant surprise was the bathtub with a whirlpool & soothing jet streams.  Both the heating & air quality in the apt. were excellent.

I highly recommend Sue’s apartment and hope to return!"

Gil is very detail oriented and thought about every last thing one could possibly need during their stay. From extra razors and toothbrushes to additional linens upon request, everything was available. Gil is a very responsive host and lives in the apartment below in case you really need him. He does respect your privacy and checks in periodically on the app to ensure you are enjoying your stay. 

The home is well equipped and beautifully decorated. There are several good restaurants nearby and a corner store next door. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. I will definitely be returning.  Thank you Gil!"

However, a couple of the guests staying at the apartment were very rude and inconsiderate. When using the shared bathroom the other guest would knock on our door to hurry us up, despite only being in the bathroom for 5 minutes which we didn't appreciate. Noise travels very easy in the apartment, and the other guests would arrive very late in the night and leave very early the next day banging the door and talking very loudly. We would constantly wake up during these times, and failed to get adequate rest. We did end up confronting them to politely ask them to keep the noise down, however, our complaint was ignored. We informed the host of our issue but we felt like no action was taken as the other guests continued to be loud. Beside that the location of the apartment was very convenient. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're planning to stay in NYC for more than 1-2 days, as it was the only downside to our 12 day trip to NYC"

He is a native of Washington Heights so we are very familiar with the area, and for someone who is visiting and may not know the area, this is a great place to stay. The subway is just a block over and there is plenty of restaurants, fast food and grocery stories close by. The place is small, but perfect for two people. In the wake of the coronavirus, I had to stay an extra night because my flight got cancelled. Jhunior allowed my boyfriend and I to stay for another night, which took alittle stress of our shoulders. The only “bad” thing I could say is that the heater is very loud and you can hear your neighbors in the apartment above you, but that is out of Jhuniors control so we hold nothing against him. Place is great, host is great, would defiantly stay again."

I love how there is two rolls of shades that can make the entire room dark even if it’s sunny and bright outside. The room service was good. Only thing that was annoying is the room says it’s a city view but when U open the window all u see if a brown building directly across with a. Big banner that says DOGPOUND. Other than that will stay here again"

I loved how different the room looked compared to other hotels in the city, definitely more advanced than other hotels with furniture and style. My stay here was great. The only little teensy issue i had was with the air conditioning. It was so warm in the room and i had trouble with AC as the temperature stayed at 77 degrees Fahrenheit all night and it made it difficult to stay asleep. I attempted to adjust the temperature but  it only got cooler at random times and then would turn off. It was as if it had a mind of its own. Other than that it was great. Definitely recommend others to stay here and to avoid AC problems lol call the front desk (shouldve probably done that haha)"

But Airbnb as body and their customer care...absolute rubbish. Greedy, conniving and always put their selfish desires before guests. Suck at gathering evidence, disgusting resolutions and I’d personally rate Airbnb 2 star. 

Cheers."

A comfy queen size bed with a balcony over looking the city. If the weather was nicer, the balcony would’ve been more enjoyable. Overall, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at the Arlo.

The rooms are small and the terrace room was on the 3rd floor with no view of the city. Patio furniture was filthy and minimal with no real feel to it. Don’t be mislead by pictures of their rooftop thinking it’s the actual room. Additionally the first night I got there the terrace room I booked “wasn’t available” and I was put in a different room with no terrace which I paid for. Avoid staying here unless you want a cheap stay in a decent location otherwise it’s overpriced and intentionally deceitfully marketed. The fridges don’t work either so be prepared for that. Rooms are also not well cleaned and generally neglected."

I enjoyed everything about it mainly because the place itself was very clean and exactly what I wanted since I didn’t know how I felt about being in a house with a family. It is like a hotel appartment, you don’t have to worry about being in someone’s else home, roomates were very quiet, nice and clean. It is also 5 min from a metro station and all essential businesses like laundry mats, grocery stores, nail salon etc. There also is an amazing bar down the building with a live band which plays great music all the time!I had the misfortune of having to leave earlier than expected, actually exactly one week after I got there due to the Covid-19 pandemic, my home country decided to suspend all international flights without prior notice on a Sunday, so I had to rush to the airport and get on the last flight out to avoid staying stranded in the US and possibly overstaying my visa. I informed Kaz very last minute literally before I left the place and as usual they responded very quickly, were very understanding which was so reassuring as I had so many things to handle last minute before I left. Once back in my home country of Morocco, I contacted them to cancel the rest of the stay and possibly get a refund as this is considered as force majeur, they were understanding and also very helpful with the refund process. With the situation getting worse every day, refund policies were being changed constantly which was very confusing, Kaz stayed in touch the whole time trying to help me through this until he found a solution and did it from his end, which I truly appreciate. They were so professional and this is the type of host you want to look for, professionnal and understanding. Hopefully the situation gets better and everything goes back to normal for me to be able to go back to NYC and I will definetely only stay at this place for the next time and the times after. Regardless of the whole situation, they really made this the best experience I have ever had with any host. Thanks again to Kaz and to the whole team, Stay safe!"

It doesn’t  have a tv but we used our own laptop just fine with the wifi connection. You share a wall with neighbors as most NYC apartments do, so you hear some chatter but nothing too loud.

"9026","34207413","618107227",2020-03-14,32624560,"Tim","Perspective/Purposes of this trip: Basketball Tournament at Madison Square Garden

Pros: 
- Location to Value ration - Can't get a better location for the price. My intent (before the CONVID-19 ruined it) was to go back and forth between Madison Square Garden (MSG) and the hotel. Underneath MSG is Penn Station, the hub of all railroad travel. Ideal location
- Solo Traveler - Perfect for a single bed with a private bathroom and TV.
- Front Desk and Communication - Very helpful when dealing with CONVID-19 and had to leave earlier than expected due to a change in flight. 

Others:
- Even though they list it in the overview section, the taxes upon arrival is sorta unusual as you expect everything to go through AirBnb.
- The additional $15 resort fee should just be called the wi-fi fee. The to-go breakfast is bagels and muffins. (Also it's not FREE wi-fi if you have to pay the resort fee)
- As you can expect with pretty much anywhere in New York, noise level outside your window seems to go on 24/7 and the walls are thin so you can hear/feel doors closing in the building. Bring ear plugs and sound machine if you are a light sleeper.
- Amenities really only include a place to sleep, shower, and watch TV as there is not much outside of that. Also you are in NY so you should be out and about exploring.

Overall: This place is ideal for the solo traveler who is just looking for a value-based place to stay. If your expectations are of a chain hotel, you are going to be disappointed. I was going for the value play and it checked that box off. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because a 5 out of 5 means it exceeded my expectations compared to what i booked. Overall, I would recommend this place."

"9028","34208803","619203407",2020-03-16,71867054,"Andrew","The place is as advertised! Small one bedroom living space no kitchen but small mini fridge, coffee table and tiny bathroom. Everything you need for a short stay essentially. I wouldn’t recommend this stay if you’re looking for a truly, comfortable, “home feel” for your NYC/Brooklyn stay. This palace is perfect for a trip on which you don’t plan on being at your Airbnb much and just need somewhere close to a train line, not in the city. 

I would recommend to the owner to change the material used for the curtains. The curtain by the bed provided no shade as it needs to stay up to allow the AC to run. This is a small room but boy did it get hot in here, even in the end of winter. The AC unit will cool the place, but takes a minute. However, the curtain just allowed the sun to shine right thru so don’t plan on sleeping in at the stay. Furthermore, I picked a bad time as there’s construction right out front of the window on a new building. That wasn’t fun waking up to. 

All in all, worth the stay for kind of trip as I described above. Laura the host is excellent and very open communication."

I never met Cherry, and she gave me someone else's # to provide me check-in instructions. A day or two before I arrived when Air bnb sent the address, I realized it didn't match the address Cherry's friend gave me. I asked her about it and she said she was in the process of updating. Seemed sketchy, but fair enough. My boyfriend drove me to the location(I was arriving two days after my check-in day after communicating this to host), and opened the lockbox upon instruction for an S key. The key was nowhere to be found, only a W key, so I took this key thinking maybe I was supposed to be given this instead. 

It didn't open the door, and I was trying to contact Cherry's friend, who gave me instructions to knock and the other airbnb guests would open the door. She blamed the housemaid for misplacing my key, and said it would be on the table. After 20 minutes, I was let into the airbnb. The trash was overflowing, there was chicken starting to rot on the counter with the juices flowing out of it (an unopened bag of chicken, yes, with the bloody juices leaking out of it sitting on an empty cereal box) and a mop/broom lying on the floor. It looked like someone was half-cleaning. On top of this, my key was nowhere to be found. What a disaster. I was messaging Cherry's friend, who had me send her pictures of the table (without a key on it) and kept offering other places the key might be, such as the cabinets. (????). After I text the host my boyfriend was uncomfortable leaving me without a key(let's be real he was about to have a heart attack seeing the dirty state of the apartment) she then offered me a place in Astoria. I would have taken it but at this point, I didn't trust the host at all, especially since they already gave me a different address than the one I signed up for. I read all of the reviews and know the original spot was a 5 floor walk up. Airbnb took care of the situation, but Cherry didn't cancel my stay for almost two weeks, so that's how long it took after much dialogue with airbnb. This was a disappointing experience that I am writing about, so that NO ONE ELSE goes through what I did. It was the dirtiest kitchen/space I've seen in a while. There is no excuse for this, especially with a pandemic going on."

It does take about just over an hour to get to downtown Manhattan but having a nicer apartment was completely worth the time to me.  There are city noises all the time (you will have this anywhere within 2 hours of Manhattan) so I recommend a white noise machine if you are not used to this.  Crystal was a great host that always responded quickly and went out of her way to work with me when I was having difficulty with Airbnb."

"9146","34410542","622461383",2020-04-15,340816208,"Lesley","No hot water, and no heat during my entire stay as mandated by NYS law when the weather is below 55 degrees. I called and made a report with 311 every day that these amenities were missing. I called Airbnb within 24 hours of noticing this issue, and they told us to stay put while they figure out where to place us. That call from Airbnb for a new placement never came. Instead, the host suggested I bathe myself and my two toddlers out of a pot of hot water. He then proceeded to block my number because I was “causing him too many problems” with my complaint. Later, he apologized and said he was acting so rudely because his friends died from COVID-19. Sorry for your loss but what does this have to do with me having to heat up water in your pot just to have warm water to bathe myself and my kids in? Airbnb refuses to acknowledge that they enabled this reckless and negligent behavior from the host. We were supposed to be accommodated in a new apartment or hotel and we never were. What were our other options? We were in NY for a reason that week and that is where we chose to stay. If we knew we would deal with that we would have chosen to stay elsewhere. I realize there’s a lot going on in the world today but wrong is still wrong, and you don’t play with people’s money or kids. That should be rule of thumb. 

Ramon Nuñez/Sanchez heal your heart. You’re a disgusting person, and I hope you and Airbnb expect litigation when the global health concern clears up."

I've been apart of the AirBnB community for about six years (my husband and I are U.S. Army veterans so we'vehad pur share of traveling around the world. In all of my time checking out AirBnB's, I've never seen anything worse than what I saw during my stay with Nubia and Company. Upon entry, the place doesn't smell bad or anything, but the place wasn't clean AT ALL. Both bathrooms were extremely dirty, there was hair on the floor, in the sink, in the shower and in the tub. The kamodes were absolutely disgusting, there was urine on the bowl itself, urine on the floor nearest the bottom of the toilet and hair and old urine on the toilet seat. There was a soiled towel hanging in one bathroom and the 'rug' for the bathroom was a folded towel. The other bathroom had no placement rugs. The master bath has a clogged sink and there's a lot of gunk in the sink as a result of a slow drain and people deciding to use the sink anyway. You are given a towel for each guest, but no wash cloths or toiletries. My family and I had to reach out to Nubia and Company to bring tissue to the AirBnB for us. The hosts didn't respond to us for almost an entire day and didn't bring tissue until the following day. My husband and I had to use baby wipes to sanitize ourselves from bathroom use. When asked to bring tissue, Higorf brought one roll of tissue for each bathroom. The bathrooms obviously ended up needing tissue again, but no additional tissue was ever brought to the AirBnB. The kitchen upon entry was more than untidy, there was a sink full of dirty dishes and a refrigerator full of spoiled milks and molded food. The microwave was absolutely disgusting and the utensils tasted like Fabuloso. LIKE THE UTENSILS WERE SOAKED OR CLEANED WITH FABULOSO! I ended up washing the dirty dishes, cleaning out the microwave and cleaning the bathrooms because I was absolutely disgusted, especially given COVID-19. Other guests were allowed to use the AirBnB,obviously for other rentals and there was only one couple that respected houserules. Everyone else was smoking marijuana, not abiding by quiet hours, and allowing additional guests into the AirBnB. My husband and I have a child and the reeking smell of marijuana was unacceptable. If I could provide less than one star for this AirBnB, I seriously would. I've seen a few bad reviews on this place, I wonder why they haven't been banned from renting."

I stayed at Park Central during the Covid 19 pandemic as a healthcare provider whose stay was paid for through the AirBnB Open Homes for Medical Providers program. Overall the hotel is lovely- steps from Central Park and the train station, sparkling clean, with amazing housekeeping staff that kept the rooms and common spaces super clean. The space was primarily being used by Krucial Staffing nurses and upon check in I was given very little orientation by the front desk. I was also asked when I tried to check in if I was a delivery person- a bit puzzling as I had a suitcase with me. The hotel was mostly occupied by travel nurses who did not always wear a face mask in the common areas or in the elevators which made me a bit uncomfortable, but this was not the hotel’s fault. Otherwise a very nice stay."

The décor is cute, the bathroom is large - 2 sinks! - , the bed is comfortable, and overall the place is immaculate.  Further, you can't do better with the location, in the heart of the trendy Bedford Ave area with its great restaurants and shops.  Enoch was wonderful communicating and flexible when we changed our plans.  I highly recommend this place!"

Away from the tourist areas, but only a 2 minute walk to the subway station and you can be in Time Square or Wall Street in about 30-40 minutes. Plenty of grocery stores nearby if you want to grab some drinks for your day trip into the city. The bed is comfortable and clean. The room is not dead quiet, but I don't think anywhere in NYC would be quiet. I had no problems sleeping at all. I'm very thankful to find this place and after reading all the positive reviews, I was confident it would be a good stay. I would stay here again."

The apartment was clean and relaxing, true to photos. The washer and dryer were a huge plus.  We appreciated the apartment's front facing patio that looked out onto the sand dunes and boardwalk (can't see the beach from the vantage point but it was relaxing all the same.)

Only issue is that the private patio isn't private: the owners live upstairs and the small concrete landing is in the middle of their family's backyard. The family hangs outside and on the driveway that runs the length of the apartment. Privacy is minimal."

The place has everything you'll need for a short or long stay. The kitchen is fully-equipped with spices, cooking tools, pots, and pans and the stove and oven work well. The bathroom is nice and has stuff like hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, etc. and you'll find hotel-sized soap and shampoo in the bedroom. A washer and dryer is available in the basement, so no need to go to the laundromat, but you'll have to use your own detergent.

I stayed in bedroom B, which is very nice. There's enough closet space, a sturdy desk for doing work and whatnot, and the bed is very comfortable.

The only negative I can think of is the water dispenser on the refrigerator lets out water at a tiny trickle, so it takes 5 minutes to fill up a bottle or glass. Besides that, this place is amazing.

Abena is a great host! Couldn't ask for anyone better. She is the friendliest and most accommodating person. Any questions or concerns I had were answered promptly and she was happy to resolve any issues I came across (there were only 1 or 2).

I enjoyed my time here very much and would definitely recommend staying here."

Also, there are restaurants so if you are hungry can go there. 
Attention was amazing! We loved how Laura treated us and everything on the apartment is pretty nice, cozy and is a little bit bigger than it seems on photos. 
Amazing place!"

"9487","35086241","618716814",2020-03-15,30898898,"Vladimir","I booked 2 nights via Airbnb few days ago. Airbnb added all taxes and showed me a TOTAL price 163.06 $. But when I arrived to the hotel's reception I was charged in addition for 20$ per night. So in total I paid 203$. If I saw this total amount on Airbnb I would not book this hotel, because it would not be a bargain for me.  When I asked what is this tax got an answer that it was on a description on Airbnb site and got a printed page with the site description as a proof. So of that I can make a conclusion that they often being asked about this 20$\night tax. Why do I need to read description for hotels? What if the write 5000 words and add at the end ""each night +100$""? I consider it as a cheating. Moreover, they hold 25$ per night, if you use something in your room. My checkout was yesterday but still have 90$ on hold. So the total is 203$ +90$ on hold, and a nebulas perspective to return my 50$. I have never faced with such a bad customer experience. Once again, looks for me like a cheating, otherwise they should have added their special tax to total price, not at description. Advantages of this place are: friendly and helpful personnel and nice location."

Unfortunately, due to the coronavirus, we have to shorten our trip, but we will definitely consider the place again if we revisit NYC in the future.

The apartment has what you need, and is good for a short stay if you want to be conveniently located in a cool neighborhood. It's quite quiet, even though you are in the middle of Manhattan!

We stayed at Rachel's place, while at the same time the Covid-19 pandemic broke loose, and being in this apartment 24/7 for 3 weeks, that's not what it's necessarily made for."

Es un ambiente familiar, puedes pedir encargos de Amazon y páginas similares y con gusto te los entregarán. También tendrás tu espacio en la nevera y la posibilidad de usar toda la cocina.
Es recomendable para estancias cortas ó largas,  también está en un barrio en Queens muy tranquilo y cercano a gran variedad de comercio. Se puede llegar a Manhattan por metro, que está solo a unas pocas calles, es un lugar residencial muy central.
Este definitivamente es un alojamiento 5 estrellas, te proporcionan juego de cama y toalla.
Espero volver pronto. Gracias Jessi!!!!"

We stayed in NYC at a very interesting time with covid19 starting to impact the operation of the city but Misha and Jasper were so good at keeping us updated on things and making suggestions on what to do. Their apartment is a really great space with everything you need. We found the room very comfortable and well equiped, check-in and out were very smooth. Williamsburg is full of amazing restaurants, bars (loved Horses and Divorces), brunch spots (Gotan and Devocion were personal faves), thrift shops etc so we were so glad that we made the decision to stay there and dip in and out of Manhatten and Brooklyn when we fancied it. Due to covid19 we avoided the subway and used the ferry system instead, if we were to return to NYC we'd do the same again as it was a great way to travel and see the skyline. Overall, we loved our stay even though we had to escape the impending lock down early, and we'd definitely stay again! Thank you Misha and Jasper!"
"9518","35152601","618553174",2020-03-15,13608264,"Jill","Great location-

Our stay was a mixed bag. 

The good-
-The apt was in a great location - close to great restaurants, shopping and train stops.
-Apt was very clean
-Apt was very quiet
- Alex and his host, Andrew were very friendly
-Alex let us store our bags in the apartment 3 hours before check in.
- powerful internet that handled 4 people’s devices AND 3 additional devices for my work

The expected - the apartment was tiny (it is NYC after all!)

The not so good (not a deal breaker, but would have wanted to know ahead of time)
- we had 4 towels for 4 people for a 3 night stay. No hand towel for the bathroom (after washing hands) or wash cloths for washing face.
- no top sheets on the beds. Andrew said they do wash the duvet covers after each guest so that’s good...
-very flat pillows - that was not a problem for our teens but might something others would want to know 
-no coffee in the apt! 2 coffee makers but no coffee. Not a huge deal since you can literally walk out the front door and find coffee in any direction, but my husband has to have it as soon as his eyes open.
- while communication was very friendly, Alex missed some messages. Once he noticed the missed message, he did act quickly and effectively to fix one problem (1 roll of toilet paper for 4 people!) and they tried to fix the other issue but couldn’t
- TV could not get on the internet - they couldn’t figure it out. Not a huge issue - teens just like watching Netflix as they go to sleep after a long day.

Overall - this is a clean place in a good location."

There was a bag with a banana peel & trash on the ground by the lounge chair next to the fridge when we got there. The counters, sink, & table were dirty with food crumbs & stains. The table is broken. We killed about 6 or 7 roaches in the kitchen before the end of the first day alone! We never touched the counter besides to clean it. The microwave was disgustingly dirty with stains. The bathtub was dirty & looked like someone had just used it right before we got here bc there was water & dirt in the tub when we got here. I’ve never had an Airbnb or hotel or apartment like this. Not what I expected at all. Freddy seems like a nice person but this is not worth what I paid! The apartment is not depicted like this on the app & it’s very uncomfortable especially for my fiancé’s first impression of New York! There were swarms of gnats at the entrance of the property. People hanging out on the porch all day. The parking was sooo hard to find. I didn’t get much help from the host as his solution to my issues was to offer me another night in this mess of a place. Why would I want to stay ANOTHER night there??!? He claimed that a cleaner came before we got that but there was no way anyone cleaned that place before we got there!! I have photos! I swept the floor and the amount of dust, dirt, & debris that I swept up showed that this place hadn’t been cleaned for quite sometime!"

It does remind one of staying at the Carlisle Hotel, with high ceilings and more space.

I enjoyed staying here and would stay again. The location was ideal for me, on the Upper East side, one block from the Frick Museum and half a block from Central Park. The apartment was clean and the bed comfortable. The shower had a good strong water flow and there was plenty of hot water. The air conditioning units worked well; it was over 80 degrees and humid outside but cool inside.

I didn’t have any problems for the hosts to solve, but the interactions I did have with Maria and George were pleasant."

I honestly didn’t feel comfortable staying in a hotel due to all of the current health concerns for our nation so we decided to look into Airbnb. 

We found David’s Place and browsed pics and reviews and proceeded with making the reservation. It was late in the evening and we honestly didn’t expect to be able to check in that night but decided to try anyway and to our relief.....our stay was confirmed! We drove out to find our host waiting for us! After a little tour and being made to feel very welcome, we were given the exterior and interior keys. Everything was clean, smelled fresh and comfortable!

I am definitely planning to stay at David’s Place when I return to the city."

OFF THE BAT, YOU WON'T DEAL WITH CARMEN.  The number you receive for her goes nowhere and we were reached out to by a man named Jose claiming that he was Carmen's son.

We stayed here Memorial Day weekend and in the first day, a bum got in and ""defecated"" in the hall and on the wall.  We were willing to look past that and the fact that the oven didn't work properly, because we understand you can't control that sometimes.  
*HOWEVER THE NEXT PART IS WHY YOU SHOULDN'T*

My boyfriend left an outfit in a closet when we checked out and I reached back to Jose to tell him and ask how we can come back to get it, since he had messaged to see if we checked out.  Mind you he was not responsive the entire duration of the experience.  Long story short, he kept responding saying he had the outfit and would meet us and then he would go dark.  Finally my boyfriend was told he could come to where we rented and then told the person wasn't there and to come at 1:30.  Then that the door should be open.

My boyfriend knocked and announced who he was, the male in the apartment stuck his head out of a room and looked at him then told him he could come in.  The male went back in the room and my boyfriend announced again he was there to get his pants and the guy didn't respond and then my boyfriend asked if he could come into the room where the man was because that's the closet we'd left it in.  The man said yes and then when he saw my boyfriend come in, lifted the blankets, was completely nude and got on all fours with his butt facing my bf.  

Airbnb says they can't do anything, but this isn't okay And if I as a woman went, the whole situation seems like a sick set up.  He was told by the ""son"" in there messages that the door would just be open.  This is absolutely not okay.  

**PS** I just have to say that I literally couldn't make this shit up if I wanted to."

If you are visiting New York and want the vibe and feel of New York City this is it."

Quite intimidating to be sneaking into a building. We had some trouble finding the building but the host was very nice and guided us there . Once we got there the door was locked . We were told it would be unlocked with the key inside . I contacted the host and she mentioned that her cleaning lady should’ve left the door unlocked for us. Then, the host decided to make her way to us (again really nice) but to everyone’s surprise - NO one cleaned the apartment. The host tried to quickly tidy up for us but even when she left the place was so filthy and aside from that, we had no clean towels or blankets and if we wanted to get some WE had to go downstairs to ask for it and lie about who we are getting it for. We just wanted to come to an Airbnb to relax. Instead we were cleaning, finding dirty towels next to the bed from previous guests. The bed is sunken in the middle and so incredibly uncomfortable . Tub was slippery and dirty again, from previous guests. Although it’s a gorgeous apt , it’s apparent no one cares for the guests accommodation. I wasn’t going to leave a bad review but seeing how I was told we were getting the cleaning fee back which I have yet to receive , I’m disappointed ."

Dirty linens inside the hallway closet .The bed was broken which was very uncomfortable I’m still dealing with back pains due to that.

The are Bushwick has the most amazing street art around Wycliffe district and I believe many artists and arts spaces that we didn't get to see as 'lock down' had already happened.

It was welcoming and comfortable and the kitchen was very well equipped, which made it easy to cook meals at home. There is a closet where you can hang a few clothes and keep your suitcase, and if needed a dry cleaner is right next to the building.  There is a tv to view Netflix and I never had issues with the wifi. You can sometimes hear the neighbors, and I only heard 1 party the entire 2 weeks I was there, but this is part of the beauty of being in an airbnb - an authentic experience as a resident. The view from the apartment overlooks 53rd street, a quite street with trees and small buildings featuring New York's distinctive fire escapes.  You are a 2-minute walk to the waterfront, while Sutton Place is a nice residential area beautifully kept, with greenery and a couple of small hidden parks and interesting buildings. I suggest viewing the houses on Sutton Square, Parisian-style homes on 53rd and 2nd, and taking a break at Green Acre Park or in the Park on 51st and Beekman Place. You are a 5-minute walk from wholefoods and many restaurants like Tomi Jazz (which hopefully will soon re-open).  It is also very close to Tudor City and about a 10-minute walk from Rockefeller center and 15 minutes from Grand Central Terminal. 
I didn’t get to meet Hagar, but the check-in process was very simple and she always responded within minutes."

We landed super early Friday morning. Jey was great about letting us check in hours early, right after landing (and battling rain and traffic to get there). 

The instructions to get in were very simple. 

Did I love climbing up 4 flights of stairs? Nope. But I expected it. Did I think it was going to be a 5 star resort, absolutely not. 

The apartment was quirky and cute. The location was ideal. It had all the necessities we needed (including tp ;) ) the bed and couch were super comfortable. The lighting in the apartment was great. There was plenty of hot water. There wasn’t anything to complain about. 

We arrived before the city was all locked up. We saw some great sites without any large cross. We were among the last groups in the library, Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building before the quarantine. Then we flew home to isolation. 

Thank you for a great experience. Our show (the whole reason we were visiting) was rescheduled to December. Hopefully we will be back for that and the city will be back to normal."

It's a very ""New York City"" apartment, meaning there are things you put up with because you're in the city. Pros include a large fridge, hot water, Roku TV, and rather spacious. Cons include smelling the Thai restaurant's kitchen over the lunch hour and all evening, and sometimes kitchen staff's cigarettes, through windows that must be open to provide relief against the heat from radiators; houseflies to accompany the kitchen odors; an exceptionally weak WiFI signal that didn't even extend to the two bedrooms -- we were stuck in the living room to be on our devices; the place was clean but that living room shag carpet needs to be shook(!); an overly firm bed with nearly useless thin foam pillows and a sheet and comforter that barely covered us; I learned to fry an egg with a spoon because the kitchen lacked a spatula. After a while, the feel of the place was mediocre, like nothing was so nice that anyone would steal anything. These may not be especially important complaints if you're visiting NYC for a long weekend and are out all the time. However, I had to spend the vast majority of the day indoors due to lockdown, and it was not pleasant overall."

The apartment above me has access to my apartment and can rented out together. Fine but there are two doors that access between the two apartments BUT only one of them can be locked. therefore at anytime anyone in either apartment can access each apartment through a door that does not lock. On top of this the main door to the apartment above with access to mine the lock was broken so the front door was accessible to anyone. This was addressed and the lock was fixed 5 days after I checked in so I had to make a makeshift lock on the door for my own safety. 
Next another airbnb guest moved into the lower apartment as was smoking marijuana inside the building. it smoked up the whole building including my apartment for two days. I told the owner about the situation he ensured he would take care of it. His house keeper Jonathan sent me the text to the other tenants. but hours later it was potent AGAIN, they did not stop.... As this was causing me issues to breath and giving me headaches I then asked to check out early and if I could please get a refund for the rest of my stay. He refused to offer a refund for the remaining days even under the circumstances. I was very upset with how this host handled the situation  I felt like it was very unprofessional and plan rude I do not know how you could expect anyone to stay in an environment like that when the other guests clearly kept smoking in the building. 

Overall I was very unsatisfied with how the host handled problems because he seemed to think they were irrelevant. 

On the other hand the apartment was great, it was very clean and  Jonathan the house keeper meet me at the door to give me the keys left me some Lysol spray due to the current times and tell me how everything worked. there was plenty of toilet paper, and paper towels everything was fully stocked. There were even some little keurig coffee pods.   I adored the roof top it was nice and private and I could enjoy a good workout outside. It was really  too bad that I had leave the place early."

Sofia was an amazing and communicative host, and made me very comfortable and at ease. The apartment is a bit small, but it never feels crowded, even when people are home. Very mellow respectful vibe. I think the place best serves quiet, considerate folks who can appreciate good overall value. Seems like a great fit for European travelers exploring nyc, quiet grad students etc."

Ashli has prepared everything from towels , she even did my laundry. I had access to the garden which is so important to me, as I had to stay in much of the time as New York is experiencing social distancing rule. The neighborhood is nice for walking and not far from the park. I would come back again to them."

Liegt etwas außerhalb, aber ohne Probleme mit der U-Bahn zu erreichen. Zudem ist ein Teil der Columbia Universität in der Nähe, wodurch auch mehr Security unterwegs ist.

Alles war sauber und die Gastgeber waren super nett und haben uns bei allen Fragen geholfen und Tips gegeben. 

Das Zimmer ist allerdings nicht all zu groß, was uns aber nicht gestört hat, da wir sowieso den Tag in der Stadt verbracht haben. Und man hatte keinen Tisch falls man mal in der Unterkunft essen will. Kann man aber ja durch Essen in/am Bett ausgleichen.

Fazit: Immer wieder gern. Und wirklich empfehlenswert."

The place was also amazing in terms of cleanliness, location, and safety. I stayed at Eniko's place for about a month on a fellowship and it was nice to be able to relax in a warm and cozy spot after work, especially during the NYC winter season.

Eniko was also very helpful and accomodating throughout the coronavirus pandemic. I was very glad and relieved to have a host that was as kind and caring as her. I definitely recommend this place if you want to visit West Village/Manhattan!"

The photos are quite realistic of what the apartment is actually like, and the place looks beautiful especially when the sun is shining. The kitchen and bathroom were very well stocked and had everything I would have needed. Moreover, the location was also great and I absolutely loved having a balcony with a view of downtown Manhattan. Only flaw i'd probably say is that it was quite hard to use the TV and the three remote controls. :)"

Our bed was incredibly comfortable, the  temperature in the apartment toasty and warm, and the lounge/kitchen drenched in sunlight. The apartment's location is not far from the subway, and whilst nearby eateries were a little more difficult to find, we fell in love with Saraghina restaurant and bakery and its welcoming staff - what a find! We loved the neighbourhood vibe and felt safe walking home at night. Vanessa was very easy to contact when we had issues with the digital entry system, and kept in touch when necessary throughout our stay."

Really a hidden Gem right in BK !

Checking in was a quick and easy. Vanessa went above in beyond to accommodate our last minute Girls Getaway. 

This apartment is absolutely stunning, sparkling clean and well designed. You can really tell our wonderful host Vanessa put a lot of care in attention into the decor, my friends & I loved it. 

Great take out options in the area. We had a tasty brunch from a local soul food restaurant called Peaches .  Food is always great. 

Which leads me to say the backyard was the best part about our stay. It’s so Chic and with a little imagination we felt like we were really at a nice outdoor lounge / restaurant 

Overall this was an amazing stay."

We were extremely disappointed that  she did not respond to this message. We then sent another message a couple of days later but still have not had a response. In our message we were seeking either a refund or credit or a partial refund or credit for a future stay.

If you're a social person, shes fun and great to talk to and respects your space. Full disclosure,  the bathroom door doesnt lock,  so if that's somethingthat bothers you keep it in mind. I also suggest bringing your own towels/toiletries as none were readily available. During my stay I was not provided with a set of keys of my own , so coming and going as I pleased was a little annoying , as I had to let Danica know everytime so she could disable the alarm. To my knowledge she will have another set available in the future. This is the kind of place that's most suitable for quick overnight stays or layovers,I wouldn't reccomend it for longer stays.

When we arrived, the host left us some tasty healthy snacks which is definitely a plus! Their big screen TV in the living room which was connected to heir Netflix (thank you) helped us create our own movie nights during our stay. any questions I had, the host was very responsive. The apartment is located above the hosts - but surprisingly I did not feel like an intruder ... I am a night owl and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to get work done, watch TV or sometimes eat. However, I was not able to hear what was going on downstairs and I received no complaints about my late night strolls to the kitchen lol. I highly recommend staying at this location - there is a grocery store that serves hot and cold sandwiches that are affordable and tasty. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your home and for being so understanding!"

My interaction with them was impeccable and prompt.  The caretaker of the apartment seems to be where the issues I had stemmed from.  Unfortunately there was no AppleTV that was mentioned in the listing.  The tv on the other hand was there and was amazing.  It was so big. Loved it.  The common areas building were anything but the normal expectation of being clean. It was the opposite.  The apartment itself needed to be cleaned up some when I arrived I met the live in tenants there as well.  There were mice which was not what I was expecting to see.  There were two of then by the way.  The neighborhood is not the best neighborhood in the city either.  The place could be great if the caretaker took cleanliness more seriously got rid of the mice."

It is priced accurately i believe. I wouldn’t plan on spending time in the apartment but serves the purpose of somewhere to sleep & a good close location to the action. There were a good amount of “characters” outside but it’s NYC after all. It was lacking in some essential items but we booked super last minute. They had it ready for us with only a few hours notice. Across the street is a great deli/store named Hell’s Kitchen. We got a few meals from there. Great prices and pretty good meals. They also have fresh juice."

We weren’t happy with our stay and got a full refund ! Only to be cursed at and harassed by Bernard a host claiming we smoked in the room ! Just because some one is black with dread locs and lesbian doesn’t mean they are disrespectful people! We were accused of smoking and harassed even tho we clearly booked a backyard if we ever needed a smoke! Then they told us 90 % of Airbnb’s are in bad neighborhoods like this one and this is the best you can get !

The person in room #3 was very loud and smoking marijuana. Very bad location with cops all around and people walking very loud in the streets.

The area is  well developed consisted of three banks Chase, Capital and also TD bank, a gym also along the main road.  As for transportation you will never be stranded several bus in the area along with The M train.  Lots of Restaurants, vegetables stores along with clothing stores. With all these activities yet her street is very quiet. I will recommend anyone to come and enjoy some peace and tranquility. It will not be my last visit,  I rated her  Airbnb   as top of the line. My room was very spacious clean and comfortable. I could not have ask for anything more, I was very comfortable, oh and  I slept well. Thank you Heidi and keep up the good work."

Arie and his family are quiet, kind, and considerate. I always felt very comfortable during my stay, and I could sleep at night with no concerns. The entrance to the apartment is monitored by security camera's, so I always felt safe and secure during my stay. As for parking, free street parking was always available. 

I encountered no issues with communication, and Arie responded quickly to my messages. If you have any concerns, Arie helps to resolve them as quickly as possible. Customer satisfaction is his priority, and he does everything he can to make his guests feel comfortable. 

As for the surrounding area, it is relatively quiet. By vehicle, you are only five minutes away from various shopping centers, a grocery store, a gym, a park, and many nearby restaurants. Directly in front of Aries residence is an MTA bus stop, which is very convenient for traveling within the city. 

I greatly enjoyed the room, especially considering my extended stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the host changes the linens regularly.  For the price, Arie's place is fantastic, and I highly recommend this Airbnb to fellow travelers. Thank you Arie and family for such a wonderful stay. I hope to visit again sometime!

Sincerely,
- Donnie"

I’m sure the apartment will have been cleaned professionally since but I wish I had known to check about this as I was itchy with bites for a lot of my stay thinking I had mosquito bites, not aware of what it was. I am sure the owners will have cleaned as it was otherwise a clean apartment but I recommend checking this. 

The host denied prior knowledge of them before, so previous guests may not have reported them. That’s why I’m mentioning it here. The part I did not appreciate was that the host also implied in their reply that it was my fault. I have never known anyone to have bed bugs, let alone have them myself! I cleaned all sheets and fabrics items for them straight away to do what I could to help.

Until I noticed this I loved the apartment and definitely would have stayed here again, such a shame. The location is perfect, the rest of the apartment was clean and modern.
I have never experienced bed bugs before but for me, the stress after returning home and making sure I didn’t bring them back with me was too much and I will always be asking all Airbnb hosts in NY if they’ve had/ when they last had bed bugs. I have since found out this is a common question New Yorkers ask landlords when renting as it’s such a big problem in NY ."

Cons: Host is slow to respond. I had booked this right before covid-19 was declared a pandemic. I had a stay for 2 weeks. All my work got cancelled. I asked multiple times if he could give me a refund (full/partial) and he refused. I needed to get back home before everything shut down. I just really didn’t appreciate the fact that he had no compassion during a global pandemic. He told me “there was plenty of other things to do in nyc” I lived here for 4 years. I’m aware. On Friday Airbnb moved their extenuating circumstances policy to the USA. So I was able to get a refund after being on the phone for 6 hours. Now I’m back home and I’m glad I’m not paying 1700$ to do self isolation."

Apartment is a cute studio and he gave great recommendations that we unfortunately couldn’t use. It was worth the price we paid at the time. 

Only minor issues were lack of soundproof between apartments (worsened by everyone working from home). You can hear the neighbors speaking clearly through the vents. Buzzer wasn’t working. And our flight was cancelled due to the outbreak, so we hoped for late checkout but it wasn’t available. So we kind of just tried to avoid people around town for the afternoon."

First, the apartment address listed on this Airbnb site is not the same as the actual apartment location. 

Second, it is not furnished like the pictures. A kitchen table was there but that’s it. 

Third, it's right above a club that was operational 7 days a week. They closed around 11 or 12 every night. 

Last, and most disturbingly, is the roach infestation in the kitchen which I learned of a week in. It was horrid. I reached out to the host and they were extremely unresponsive. I had to follow up several times to get any response. 

Avoid this place at all cost."

Jeff’s place is the best place to stay in NYC. The photos are fantastic but can not begin to capture the beauty and artistic aesthetic the apartment has. It has wonderful heated floors in the modern and stylish bathroom, the rooms are all sun-soaked and bathed in natural light. The view is absolutely out of this world. Jeff thoughtfully checked in on us via message throughout our stay and accommodated our check in time. I couldn’t stop taking photos of the apartment and the quirky, individualistic pieces scattered throughout. The location is ideal, a few mins from a classic Pizzeria, several bagel joints, great bars and a subway. The neighbourhood was friendly and super colourful. We walked everywhere and felt safe doing so. The lovely folk downstairs have cute dogs too! Supermarket right round the corner. Perfect AirBnb. Can not fault it. We will be staying again!"

The kitchen is well equipped and there's a smart TV you can use and a nice garden as well. There were a few details that made our stay not perfect, as were the fact that there had been a party on an earlier date and the house had not been properly cleaned (there was a lot of trash on the door and a neighbour actually complained to us) and the host was difficult to reach. One of the smart locks got broken while we were there and it was really hard to get a hold of the host, so for the rest of our stay one of the doors was not properly locked. Also the windows on one of the rooms didn't close all the way, so you could feel all the cold and hear all the noises, which was annoying to say the very least. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay in the house."

When I arrived there was a can of raid on the table which leads me to believe that the host was already aware of the roach problem. After letting the host know he attempted to accommodate by moving me to another listing but unfortunately was not able to keep his word. The host never came to the home to check or to clean after I made him aware of the problem. Ultimately I had to leave but when I requested a refund the host wanted to charge me for an extra day that I did not stay there. Airbnb had to unfortunately resolve the issue because the host would not give me a fair refund. Only after contacting Airbnb and showing photo and video proof of the roaches did I receive the refund I deserved. The home was accurate to the pictures and information seen in the listing prior to arriving but overall it was a terrible experience due to the lack of cleanliness and communication. I would not recommend staying at this location due to what I experienced."

Love the natural light in the room and all was as expected. Built in technology such as motion sensor lights in the entry and living room made it easy to move around without fumbling over lights. Every household items was present. I also appreciated that even before we were quarantined in NYC we had sanitizer, Lysol, wipes, soap, toilet paper, and an ample stock of Vitamin C (oranges) for all guests. The other guests were polite. Deb and Robi were both very helpful hen needed and checked in when necessary giving you privacy to enjoy the space as your own. The neighborhood is fine. Just because the people are of a different culture doesn’t make them less special. I spoke with the deli owner and some of the neighbors who were all very nice and many the essential workers we depend on in NYC. It was indeed a very quiet experience with families in every house. I would definitely recommend."

It is a recommended space for anyone. 
I got helped a lot from these generous hosts.

"10457","36906882","627019788",2020-05-31,20984916,"James","Jose's place is a gem in Brooklyn. 3 blocks from the J train on Broadway and 3 blocks from the L train on Knickerbocker, 1 block from Irving Square Park, plus lots of little stores and restaurants and plenty to do in this neighborhood- you really have all you need here. 
Despite being in the middle of Bushwick it is in effect a very central location for all of New York because you are so close to the major train lines and buses, which will get you to any of the hot spots in Manhattan in about 20 minutes, Williamsburg in 15, or downtown Brooklyn in about 30.
In terms of service, I have never felt so welcomed by an Airbnb host than with Jose. My girlfriend and I stayed with Jose for a whole month so in some ways he was like a roommate, but still he was a professional and very attentive host. He helped us with our bags when we arrived, and whenever we needed something he would help and typically responded to any text message within 10 minutes, and would work to solve any problem we had until it was fixed. He is an Airbnb Superhost so he really knows what he's doing, and it shows. On top of that he's extremely generous with his time, friendly, and a pleasure to talk to and hang out with.
If you're staying in Bushwick I can't recommend Jose's enough."

If you prefer a dark room to sleep, bring something to cover your eyes. If you are a light sleeper, come back tired, do something to tire you out, or bring earplugs; you can hear every step that is taken from the apartment above. Which is not to say they were running around or stomping, that’s just the character of the building. My guest slept like a baby so it’s not loud or bad, I’m just a super light sleeper. 

Location was great for us visiting family, jumping on the bus or train & getting to where we needed to go. Great places to eat all around so we walked to pick up lunch and dinner and it was still warm when we brought it back. 

I had to rush out and travel back early from my trip and Makesi was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. We would happily stay again!"

The sleeping accommodation is very good (three double bedrooms) and the living area was fine for four of us (might be a bit cramped for more, though). The apartment isn’t huge, which is to be expected in New York, but the space has been used efficiently. Shower and bathroom were great (plenty of hot water) and the apartment was very clean. Also, it is on the ground floor so no steps or lift to negotiate with luggage. It is very quiet in the apartment at night, which is apparently a rarity, and we felt very safe in the apartment and neighbourhood day and night. There are some good restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance. Central Park is just over the road and the nearest subway and supermarket are just round the corner. This was our first visit to New York and we loved it. We’ll be back!"

"10543","37053772","627469985",2020-06-02,40068558,"Sade","I was there for May 2020. things I appreciated: great water pressure and temperature in the showers. there are three bathrooms and I never had to wait on line for one. great location. my room was on the other end of the apartment from the other rooms, the vibe was fairly chill. the space was mostly accessible. there's a dishwasher and laundry in the basement. free to wash a dollar to dry. cleaners come once a week for the common areas.

things I didn't enjoy so much: I had a really hard time achieving physical comfort. the mattress was super soft and the bed frame supporting it was slatted which made it impossible to sleep without feeling like the entire bed would buckle beneath me. also the only furniture in the room is the bed so I borrowed a chair from the dining room. there's only two washers and dryers in the basement. one dryer doesn't work and the other is very temperamental.

I'm sure I could say more, but there's a pandemic and I'm tired. the people were nice but like everything in this country and city I found it to be overpriced even though it's one of the least expensive listings on Airbnb. but if you're a thin able bodied well off person then you'll be fine and most likely will not have any issue with the space."

"10562","37116941","623539752",2020-05-01,342948698,"Esther","Melissa's place was nice, but there were a few things that I didn't like. The apartment was listed as ""quiet"", and while I understand that the hosts do not have any control over the neighbors, the neighbors were constantly partying, playing loud music, and fighting. The walls are thin, so it was actually very noisy (especially at night), and I do think that should have been mentioned in the listing. Secondly, the washer and dryer is a 2-in-1. While the washer part works, the dryer part has some kind of problem that that makes it display an error code every 10 minutes and the only way to keep using the dryer was to turn off the dryer, wait another 15 minutes, then turn it back on and let it run... just for it to display the error code again after another 10 minutes. I think that their listing should have mentioned this as well. Taking this into account, I don't think this place is ideal for a long term stay.

However, overall the experience was not bad. I couldn't get in touch with Melissa, but her cousin Andre was responsive and nice, and he helped me out during my stay."

As Soon As We Pulled Into The Neighborhood There Were so Many People Outside & In Front Of The Property That My Guests Felt Uncomfortable. The House Reeks Of Cigarettes Even Tho Signs All Over Say No Smoking. The Bathtub Was Filthy. Stains On The Sheets & On The Couches. You Can’t Use The Grill & Have The Hot Tub On At The Same Time Or The Fuse Will Keep Blowing Out Which Was Very Annoying During Our Stay. The Lights Kept Flickering In The Living Room So We Were In The Dark Most Of The Time. The Hot Tub Takes 24 Hours To Actually Heat Up To Use Which Was Pointless. The Clear Igloo In The Backyard Is Filthy Inside & The Lights Are Broken Looks Like The Wire Was Cut, The People Who Live Upstairs From The Property Were Harassing My Female Guest From Their Window, A Lot Of Gun Shots & Fights Were Happening In The Neighborhood During Our Stay And We Did Not Feel Safe. The Owner Of The BnB Doesn’t Even Visit The Property So He Had No Idea About A Lot Of Issues About The Apartment. Will Never Book This Place Again Even If It Was Free."

Concernant l’appartement, le chauffage était beaucoup trop fort. Pas de volet mais seulement des rideaux dans la chambre (personnellement cela ne nous a pas dérangé de se faire réveiller par la lumière du jour... après tout on ne vient pas à NY pour dormir!). En revanche, la salle de bain aurait mérité un peu plus de propreté. Pour une semaine, je recommande"

Upon arrival at Nico & John’s place we were content with the arrangement. This quickly changed. It became very clear that the space wasn’t originally a “duplex” but was converted into one. The bedrooms are in the BASEMENT of the building and only one room had a small window. Within the first night we encountered loud noises, roaches (in the kitchen of all places) and water bugs which immediately turned us off. In a attempt to rectify the infestation ourselves, we went out and purchased raid bombs and additional bug spray to what was already provided. Just when we thought we had resolved the problem, we saw a rat in the kitchen. Upon further inspection we found rat droppings behind the bed and on the couch, which is an immediate health risk! We contacted the host immediately and requested a refund. Their response was that they never had these problems before, which was false because there were traps laid down and bug spray provided previous to our arrival. They proceeded to offer a cleaning and extermination service but they refused to agree to the refund “due to the pandemic” and despite the hazardous conditions. We respectfully declined and booked a new reservation at another location immediately. We were completely applaud by this experience and are disappointed that the false advertisement of this place put our health at risk especially during this pandemic. If it wasn’t clear I 1000% do not recommend this place!"

I have messaged and called many times and still not received a refund from this host who scammed me saying it was a private room in listing then saying I was approved for shared room and texting me offers to get the private room I booked for an additional fee in cash (against Airbnb rules) which I refused to pay and said I would stay somewhere else. The host told me to cancel but when I looked the way he trickily had cancellation set up so he would keep all my money minus cleaning fee. So I did not get the room I paid for or a refund. Worse, Airbnb currently due to covid19 has limited staff and a wait time of several hours to several days. I got thru after a half hour once support did not look at our messages at all and just called the host to ask his side if the story and said they'd call me back but never did. The chat system sent me a reply after half a day saying they would do an investigation and would email me a form to fill out. I click the link in the email and the link literally says do not fill out the form unless I already sent money outside Airbnb otherwise report the message. There's no way to report texts to my personal number from his phone? I emailed this and they said to still fill out the form which had no option to do so then stopped replying at all, aside from a helpbot who replied many days later today (my stay was supposed to be a week,) saying I didn't qualify for covid19 refund which I never asked about! 
This has really soured me on Airbnb and I will not be using them again. Luckily my bank did read everything and will refund me. I could not fathom why a host with so many good reviews would resort to scamming, business must be really down as I saw he has many other properties. No excuse to steal from the customers you do get!!!!"

The mattress was quite uncomfortable and the kitchen is quite small and not really conducive to cooking. It's really only good for making tea and coffee and reheating food in the microwave. But there are plenty of places to eat nearby and a supermarket 200m (4 blocks) down the street. But if you spend most of your time visiting the city then the facilities in the apartment don't matter that much. The location and affordable price tag make up for the shortcomings in creature comforts.

Sent her a message asked if it was okay due to the virus and last minute booking, she said yes. I put in my check in time, paid the 150$ and drove through two states. I get to Ayas place its a building she said she would send me check in information and I never got it so I called her. She sent me an automatic text that she can not talk. I texted her I need to get in and she said I could'nt stay there because her place is a min three day stay. I said okay I will stay three days. Then she said the place was booked on the third day to take it up with airbnb. It was mothers day and I was outside for an hour with my kids crying because I had no where else to go and drove so far. She was very rude to me at first saying she had no service. I thought she was some sort of scam artist!  I was scared to cancel because it was after check in time and I didnt want to be charged. I didnt know how to contact airbnb. I started literally crying and begging her not to leave me and my kids in the street tonight. I can't drive at night. She said okay but just for tonight. Mind you I paid her and spoke with her prior to me driving to her place. Then she ask me to write a review.

And the place is so easy for distance to downtown! Also there are some snack, dish and wine glass! I'm realy recommend this house and host! 뉴욕에서 가격대비 훌륭한 숙소였어요! 호스트가 캔들을 좋아해서 복도나 화장실에도 좋은 향기가 났어요! 그리고 방도 사진보다 훨씬 넓고 좋았어요!! 코로나때문에 더 있지 못해서 아쉬웠어요!"

"10656","37366694","622972774",2020-04-23,172231602,"Nolan","DO NOT BOOK!! 
I requested to book this place for 1wk for a work related trip to help out with the covid crisis in NYC. I received 1 message from the host that approved my request to stay and accepted my payment. He requested that I provide him with my travel arrangements so I could get access to the location when I arrived. 

I provided him with all travel plans and updated him accordingly. Not one single response; for several days. I was worried something was up but I had no choice as this was for my job. The day of my flight I tried multiple times to contact him before during and after I landed. No reply. The phone number on the profile went straight to voicemail. The address to the location that was once available was no longer there. 

I was stranded at the airport with nowhere to go or stay during a pandemic. And out nearly $700. I had to pay for a hotel that night; which several were booked up due to the increased amount of travel healthcare professionals in the area. 

In order to receive a refund I had to contact air bnb and file a complaint and was on the verge of filing a police report for scam. 

Long story short after several hoops and lots of my valuable time lost I was told I would get a refund. This was around 9pm I believe. It has been 2 days and the refund has yet to be processed back into my account. 

Save yourself the trouble; book elsewhere."

The internet definitely left things to desire co side ring there was no cable and I was left to stream. The apartment was nothing glamorous and as with most places in the area had cockroaches the entire time I was there and was exacerbated by the owner working on moving stuff while I was staying there. Unfortunately the decent stay took a sour tone on the last night when after working a 12 hour shift received a text at 9:45pm ensuring I cleaned the entire apartment and be out by 11:00 despite paying cleaning fees. I never leve places a mess as shown by my reviews and didn’t on this occasion either. Just found it extremely disrespectful and wonder why I paid a cleaning fee if I have to deep clean before check out.... All in all I give it a 3/5"

Let’s not forget the deck off the study.The master bedroom was spacious with the most comfortable bed. I cooked for the first time since I’ve been working here - everything I needed was available as I prepared my favorite seafood ramen bowl.

I first felt it was unfair to do but after messages being ignored and Max profiting from me during a time of crisis without any shame, here I am. I was already in an air b and b when this was booked. I received an email that ""I"" had booked Max's home. I immediately looked and saw that their air b and b had been booked with my name and card. I immediately wrote, called and told them that this was not me and was called to clarify. I told Max what I had just discovered. I was already in a home until  April 31 and would not have booked this myself obviously.I was frantic and he knew it.I don't have this money to just be taken like this He said ""don't worry I am sure they will give you the money after the pandemic."" This is New York City and we were in quarantine if not essential workers. I contacted air b and b , they refused to return my money.  Calling my bank meant a shut down of my card during a time I had no cash and wait for a bank representative was 3 plus hours on the phone. I finally got through and shut down my card. I was still refused my money. In the meantime, I found out this was booked by someone who stayed at my house for a day. Still not me. Fraud. But because it came from my phone I was not given my money. Max decided to not respond to my messages except one more time stating that they (it is a man and woman) had nothing to do with it , that I should contact air b and b. They had everything to do with it, they could return my money after I put in a formal request in air b and b, they chose not to - during a pandemic, obviously NO ONE else was renting their place and I did not stop them from doing so. They made 806.00 from me because of someone else using my phone and I can do nothing about it, talk about free money. I have filed a dispute with my bank . I will look into ALL measures to get my money back. AIr B and B is about character , not just homes and they're character sucks. Who would keep 806.00 from someone in this situation ? I advise not to bother. If they kept my money in this circumstance obviously they wouldn't think twice to act unfairly in others. I will pursue all measures to get my money back . Greed comes out in crissi and they're greed sure did."

"10752","37562202","622632358",2020-04-18,215090539,"Heath","Sadly my first and only negative review on Airbnb. I am an RN. I offered to come help with the Covid crisis in NYC for 4 weeks. I originally emailed Lara asking if she would offer a discount to a healthcare worker and she said no, which is fine.  Later she emailed me a phone number to inquire about a discount. Turned out to be a 3rd party management team who offered me a $75 discount by going around airbnb. Basically they would make more money but offered me $75 off because the airbnb fees would not be included. I declined and ended up booking the reservation through airbnb as I believe that is the right thing to do. After a full day of travel I arrive at the apartment to find the keys are not in the lockbox as stated in her instructions. After waiting for 20 mins for a response she replied very casually that there is a spare set at a key fob a few blocks away. So I had the pleasure of hauling my 2 large suitcases and backpack down the streets of manhattan to get the spare keys. Once I got them and went to the apartment the doorhandle\lock assembly was broken. After waiting on the stairs the manager of the apartment eventually came and attempted to work on the lock, then called a friend to do the same. After a few hours a locksmith showed up and by 9pm pm (I checked in at 4pm) I was in the apartment with a door that was operable. Once inside and unpacking I noticed the floors were quite dirty. There was a large area of sticky dark substance on the kitchen floor. There was dust, long brown hair all over the place. There was a nice rug in the middle of the living\bedroom area that had multiple toenail clippings on it. 5 days into my 30 day stay my nursing contract was cancelled. I emailed Lara and asked for a prorated refund where I would pay for 5 of the nights. Given the hassle of the checkin, the dirty apartment and the fact I was there to help with the crisis and not just on a vacation I thought it very reasonable. She replied just to say she has a strict cancellation policy but if someone rented the apartment for the rest of my scheduled days I could be refunded for those days. I have emailed her (she never gave me her # through this whole process to communicate) checking to see if anyone has rented the apartment and she has now stopped replying to my messages. All in all to try and come help NY during their time of need I lost about $3500 of my own money in one week ($2200 of that being my apartment cost). The apartment is very nice, it has great amenities and an awesome outdoor patio for relaxing and fresh air. If you choose to stay here hopefully you have a better experience and are welcomed to a functional clean apartment. Just know the response times will be slow and that you are dealing with a host who lacks any sort of empathy. Very disappointing."

Unlike the description of this place, the bathroom and the kitchen IS SHARED with 3 other rooms. 

The kitchen was right in front our room and we had all the smells in our room, what was very disturbing. The other roommates started to cook in middle of the night and kept loud conversations in the kitchen! 

The bathroom was full of hairs, other roommates kept the bathroom very unclean. 

There should be better house rules to keep this place more quiet and clean."

It is in a  relatively quiet part of Brooklyn and it’s easy to get to Williamsburg, Manhattan etc, (the Metro only a 5/10 min walk), which makes it good value.  The accommodation is spacious for a city, comfortable, clean, well equipped kitchen and a huge television complete with Netflix etc.  We felt very secure, with Sonia and her family close by, and she had left lots of little bits such as snacks and drinks, spare toothpaste etc which were great to have, especially in the first few days while we explored the area and discovered where to shop.  I hope to return to Sonia’s place for another visit!  Thank you Sonia!"

Her instructions were clear and we was literally in front of the home for 30+ minutes trying to figure out her instructions how to get in the building and to even find the door number that she never provide us with. We had to knock door to door to find the right door. This was my third Airbnb and yet so far the worst experience.

Pros: 
- Very clean
- Amazing view and beautiful sunset light coming in
- Comfortable bed
- Very well equipped kitchen
- Access to entertainment like Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Youtube,... (very convenient during the COVID-19 pandemic)
- Responsive and considerate host
- Central location
- Openable windows
- Not sterile like some apartments, but personalized - as it is the Simone's home
- Laundry room is on the same floor which is very convenient 

Not even Cons, just notes:
- There is obviously some noise from city traffic, but nothing too dramatic *(opinion during quarantine times)
- Heater is very loud (but so are most of them in NY...) and we could quickly set a good temperature and turn it off."

I stayed here for 2.5 months for an internship that was cut abruptly short by the coronavirus situation. Upon talking with Jason he was able to offer me a refund which allowed me to return home and while Airbnb support couldn't even be reached, he sorted everything out.

The apartment is 8-12 minutes walking to the subway station (depends how fast you walk) and around 30 minutes to Manhattan, which was very convenient for me. There are a lot of supermarkets and restaurants (target, key food, stop and shop, Dunkin, Starbucks, fast food chains) nearby, as well as the Queens mall center.  If the slightest inconvenience happen, Monica makes sure that it is resolved completely and she always include the hosts in all apartment-related decisions. The other hosts are also very clean and respectful. You don’t have to worry about your stuff or anything. That’s because Monica makes she does a “background check” before she confirm your reservation, so know that you are safe there.  I’ve met great people in the apartment and I am definitely coming back again.

The gas stove and oven in the picture did not turn on and seem to be there for appearances only.  The deadbolt lock had loose screws and the wood of the door it was loosely attached to was damaged, like somebody hit at the lock with a hammer and tried to break in.  I cancelled the reservation within 1 hour of checking in because I did not feel safe staying there."

"10924","37805291","623877315",2020-05-03,198286354,"Danielle","WARNING! Definitely do not rent this air bnb it may look “clean” but it has ROACHES in ALL the kitchen cabinets and the bed room (dead and alive) along with bug traps in the bed room (under the bed) and in the cabinets near all the utensils that would be needed to eat and cook with. 

DISGUSTING AND ABSOLUTELY BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE FOR THIS UNCLEANINESS ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES! 
   Mind you the the hosts page clearly states a “well equipped kitchen,” however when we arrived there was only a hot plate too use and no working stove or oven, but the pictures show a stove and a oven. Must just be for show (Website hidden by Airbnb) Carlo’s friend Jaun told us that the gas is out in the entire building ... Yet when we questioned the neighbors their gas was on and working so clearly we were being lied too. Truly unfortunate as I am a first responder and was just looking for a spot to be closer to my job and instead it was a complete nightmare. Not to mention 
we did not feel comfortable or safe. 


   Lastly, I spent the entire day back and forth with airbnb trying to get us into another spot THANK GOD we had an amazing case worker, Chris who was able to assist us and get us into a different, nicer and way cleaner spot!  Overall this was a nightmare really do not suggest booking place unless it is exterminated and thoroughly revamped. We canceled within the first few hours of being here."

But the apartment is HORRIBLE. Its a basement apartment, host lives upstairs. You can hear walking and talking. 

The apartment was dirty, the dishes were, plastic knives and forks that you can tell were used. Fridge was repulsive; the shower had clearly things from previous guests, and was dirty and moldy inside. The first bedroom where i slept i was bit by bedbugs or some bug of some sort woke up with 3 bites on my back. The sheets were dirty and thw whole placed stinked of curry spice. I had a reservation for 7 days and the next day after check in immediately canceled and purchased a different airbnb.

Kenneth is a serious, nice host, concerned by safety of his guests . 
Though there are 2 things to be said to warn the future guests :
1 - The house is impregnated with the cigar and smoke smell, fresh and passed . I still can't  get rid of this odour on the things I couldn't wash, as leather bags, fur coat etc . The host gave me a mini air purifier that was of no help. 
2 - If you make a reservation for 1 person in ""the room 2 persons "" ( as it's written in the announcement ) , and invite a friend to stay several days with you , Kenneth charges the 2nd person 75$ /night. I had a very unpleasant and stressful discussion with him  on this problem.

As soon as you walk in there’s a horrible smell no idea where it came from, the TV was as huge as a dresser but what’s the point it must be from sometime in the 90s and worse part it does not work. Next thing someone removed the knob from the stove. Fridge was a disgrace so old and dirty, they had placed a vase inside fridge to catch dripping water from freezer I guess, there was black stuff who knows what it was on the fridge door and the freezer was so old and dirty I didn’t put any food there. Besides that there’s a microwave only which was ok. I immediately reached out to the host and said I didn’t think it was going to work as I had a 4 year old child with me who needs tv and I explained the oven part as I was looking forward to using it to cook for my family, host said that the other person name Lucas was somewhere in France and would tell me how the tv worked the next day. Needless to say that next day came and went and nothing. Then the next day I received a message from Lucas asking if everything was ok, again I asked about the (Website hidden by Airbnb) answer ever was received. At the end with the whole coronavirus going stronger I asked for a refund for the nights I wasn’t going to stay, I booked for 14 nights we stayed 3 and dreaded everyone of them. This super host even though Airbnb reached out on my behalf has still to this point not refund me anything. When I keep asking I receive a two word answer just saying let me see and still nothing. I submitted a resolution report and they still have not answered to this point. Hugely disappointed and I keep asking how is this person a super host. I travel to Europe booked different places all over italy and Spain and here in the US I have never had an issue. As I review this persons reviews I noticed someone else reported the tv not working and they still listed it as nothing was wrong without even fixing it. This person has not shown good faith and to be honest I should receive a refund for all my booking due to their lie when listing and I am only asking for the nights I did not stay that for all I know he could have booked for someone else as I was clear I wasn’t there. Huge disappointment. Beware and don’t expect a “luxury” from this place because nothing in it has anything that comes close to that word."

She is very friendly and caring person. Jona's dog Smithy is a very nice and playful.
The room is clean and perfect for single visitors. It has a comfortable bed, a closet, desk and a chair. 
Jona was kind enough to provide a full kitchen to cook and eat in, very clean bathroom and a living room.
The apartment is in Astoria, Queens where normally there are  lots of restaurants, parks,  banks, stores and institutions in walking distance. 
There are 2 subway lines close by with quick access to Manhattan. The area feels completely safe.
I would highly recommend! 
Thank you for the great time, Jona!"

He’s been available but not intrusive which is just perfect. I needed a stool in the lounge and it was there within the same day. 

The location of the room is also better than I could have expected. There’s a subway station pretty much around the corner and you can change to the express train to get into manhattan really fast. The walk from the local C station is safe late at night but I’m not too sure about walking back from broadway jct at night. 

My room came with its own lock so I felt safe leaving my valuables at home. The heating is also great and appreciated. 

If I return to NYC on business again I would definitely consider this place again."

I stayed with my sisters and a friend for several days and the apartment was cozy but never crowded. Our visit happened to be timed when the covid virus started to close down the city. We really appreciated the central location and 24hr market downstairs. It was a great neighborhood for walking (and maintaining social distancing) and we enjoyed our stay despite the crazy timing.

The apartment is cozy, so it made me feel like I was at home. The neighborhood is extremely safe, and there is a grocery store just a couple of blocks north. It is really easy to go downtown, you can either take the subway or the bus. I took the subway everyday to midtown Manhattan and I reached my destination within 20 minutes! 

Maggie was a great host, she always responded to my inquiries very fast and made sure that my stay was pleasant. The one thing I really liked was how she handled and responded to the whole Covid-19 outbreak in NY. After I told her that I needed to check out earlier than the original date due to some travel bans my country was imposing, she was comprehensive and helpful. 

Overall I would DEFINITELY recommend anyone to stay here, you won’t regret it!"

Their apartment is great, really big, extremely clean, with a lot of light and very quiet. It's great to have your own private bathroom right next to the bedroom. I was also able to use the entire apartment most of the times because they were working or in their own private room. It's located in a great area of Williamsburg, close to many restaurants, shops and bars but in a quiet block. You have the L line in about 4 blocks and a supermarket right in front of the building. Also you can have access to the gym for free. Wifi is super fast and you have spaces for work in the apt if needed.
Also, Courtney and Melissa were very kind with me during these strange times, I was alone in the middle of this pandemic situation and they gave me all the human support I needed during my short stay. I had to leave the apartment earlier because my flight was the last one to my country, but during my stay here, I was safe and emotionally contained. Thank you girls."

The location is by far the best part, it's about 2 blocks from a beach entrance which also has bathrooms (and usually a restaurant during better times), and a block from Key Food/CVS plaza for groceries. The place was also spotless, even cleaner than we could have expected (it looked like we were the first ones staying there ever practically). Note that the bed situation isn't the best for 6 adults (there' s technically only 4 beds, and 3 are in the same room), but definitely workable (especially if you're comfortable sleeping on couch in basement). Also note the floors / walls are quite thin, we could hear the guests above and the many planes flying over pretty clearly, but not a big deal. The kitchen is super nice as well (big gas stove and fridge). They could use some more essentials in the kitchen (baking sheets, oven mitts, spatula, etc.), but you can make it work too. Also would be cool if they had some beach stuff (umbrella/chairs) that other nearby rentals had, but they did have some beach towels. Thanks for everything!"

And I can't say enough good things about Adrian; he truly wants you to have an excellent stay. He doesn't hover, but he was ALWAYS available if I needed anything. He is very intuitive about what his guests might need, and checked in with me appropriately. I never actually met him, but I appreciated the privacy during my stressful stay as a nurse in New York.

Кухня оборудована великолепно, мы смогли готовить еду.  Постельное белье и полотенца могли быть получше.  Кровати удобные и мягкие. Новые кухня, техника, кровати и бедрум. Хозяйка быстро отзывалась.

The apartment is very spacious, more so than the photos let on! Even though there were three of us, we felt like we had plenty of room and privacy, since the apartment is laid out nicely. The sofa bed was fine and the whole place perfectly clean. Moreover, it is in an excellent location, both for transit and because it was at the crossroad of several vibrant neighborhoods in Brooklyn. We loved having a big grocery store two minutes away, and lots of options for dining out or take-out also within a quick walk. Also appreciated having a washer/dryer and big stove and oven in the apartment. If you're planning on cooking at home a lot, the cooking utensils are minimal but we managed--and for a shorter weekend stay when you'll be eating out often, this is not an issue at all. Cynthia is constantly making changes to improve the place so I wouldn't be surprised if there are new tools in the kitchen soon. I highly recommend!"

Beautiful marble floorings. 2 rooms  there, but we only rented one with no one in the other. I chilled, ate, Watched tv with my daughter on the couch with their soft blankets to match the aesthetics of the home, slept, ate again, laptopped! 

There were good vibes picked up in the Bronx which is where some of my business was. During this covid crap pretty dead in this area. I’m was so shocked everyone was out in the Bronx compared to Brooklyn. 

Brooklyn was “literally”in the house compared to the other burrows I was in. And I had no idea the host was here til they came upstairs in the middle of the night and early mornings.  The price was right. It was safe for me and my 11 y.o which was all I cared about and pretty quiet most days (4 day weekend). My daughter said They played loud music late late nights but I was in the bed slobbing. I heard nothing."

In addition to being so convenient, however, we were pleasantly surprised to find it to be a truly serene and beautiful place, even more than the pictures portray.

As she is a member of the art world, the apartment is elevated above most by its beautiful works as well as a lot of luscious house plants. Some of my favorite things (to make this review at least somehow concise):
- an amazing projector/stereo set up that made every night a movie night. I had a projector at home and can tell this one is HIGH quality. 
- a dedicated office room. Have not seen that in a lot of Airbnbs and find it to be super useful for most working travelers. 
- Stephanie's personality and speed of communication. She has allowed me to check in early, she answered all questions super fast and overall just seemed like a lovely human. 
- The bedroom is filled with light - its not big and with the two windows almost taking up one wall, it results in a beautiful light in the room all day long. 
Will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone."

We stayed here during the covid-19 pandemic and Sandy made sure we were safe and kept offering advice and checking up on us without being invasive. 

All in all a great stay. The room is perfect for two people and fully stocked with thoughtful touches and all the essential amenities.

Host ripped me off. I had to check out 3 nights early due to circumstances beyond my control. 
I messaged the host and asked for a refund of the three nights. I agreed to pay all other fees plus nights I  had actually used. 
Sadly they refused, and also refused to approve reservation change request. Seems they are only concerned with their own bottom line. 

As for the place itself, it sucks. Bed is just matress and box springs thrown on the floor. The apartment smells like fried food. Theres cats running up and down then stairs to the apartment, they live in the hallways. Only 2 burners on the stove actually light. I could go on but you probably get the picture. They are slumlords. 
Stay away!"

The apartment is on the first floor in the back of the building, super dark, and feels unclean. You can hear absolutely everything in the whole building. We were awake all night from people walking up and down the stairs. (I wouldn’t consider us light sleepers!) when we first arrived the apartment was freezing and we couldn’t get hot water. On a positive note, we contacted Anica and she promptly called the super to come by and help. The bedding was shedding fuzz all over us. All in all, we ended up leaving early. Would not stay here again."

I was never greeted , nor did I get any instructions on how I would get into the apartment. I texted the host expecting him to at least explain to me that the keys would be in the door when we arrived . I felt uncomfortable just entering someone’s home without confirmed approval. Secondly when I got into the apartment, the floors were sticky , and the table counter had to be cleaned because of some cloudy substance(could have been whatever was used to wipe down everything). The floors had to be re mopped because it felt disgusting walking around on a sticky floor which was unacceptable. Over all the place was nice , area was quiet . Speakers and lights really gave us a party like vibe, which was pretty cool ."

My grandmother passed away so I had to cancel my trip I still was told I could not have a refund (the refund policy is clear so it’s whatever) 
They will take a picture of you ID even if your ID is already verified through Airbnb
A roommate threw away my brand new tomatoes and did not have to apologize or reimburse me

If you don’t mind sharing a space it’s fine, for almost $1000 you can find much better and a place more comfortable with a lot less people. Do not make the mistake I made, it literally just makes sense to book somewhere else."

Very clean, stylish and just enough

She was very good with communication but not too overbearing.

I’m a coffee fanatic so I was glad to see she had coffee and a coffee maker.

The subway was literally steps away from the apartment.

East NY is not exactly the safest neighborhood in Brooklyn but I felt very safe.

I would love to stay at Aminahs home again.

And I recommend you do too."

My issues with this Airbnb: 

Room was VERY small. No ventilation. Room had odd smell. I had to pay additional fees upon arrival. I paid an additional $150 - $50 which is supposed to be refunded. 

* I don’t appreciate hidden fees. If that were the case, I would’ve booked a different listing from the beginning.

It's always the little things that affect my opinion of a place and this place lacked a lot of attention to detail (shampoo/conditioner, body wash bottle was empty, plugs weren't very convenient, lighting was partially jerry-rigged, etc.  However, the main things we look for in a place were present. It was clean, there was plenty of space, the kitchen was sufficient, it wasn't noisy at night, and there was wi-fi. If you need a place to stay in Brooklyn and don't care about all of the little amenities...definitely consider this space."

If the room I booked is not available you let me know and I see if there’s any other ones I’d like but your going to choose for me and when I’m talking about it your going to be disrespectful oh if I don’t want the room I should just contact Airbnb, this guy a FRAUD. The number he has on the app don’t work & I had to sleep in that room a night before I gotten another response from them. NO ONE HAVE EVER TREATED SOMEONE THATS PAYING THEY MONEY AS IF THAT PERSON WENT TO WORK FOR THEM AND BRINGING THEY MONEY BACK TO THEM. I ONLY STAYED IN THAT BNB BECAUSE I WAS WITH MY GIRL SHE FELT DISAPPOINTED SO I SAID FUCK IT I WAS GOING TO HOLD IT OUT MAYBE THE GUY MADE A MISTAKE WITH THE ROOM BUT HIS RESPONSE THE NEXT DAY, I FELT LIKE HE DIDNT CARE HE JUST WANTED OUR MONEY, BUT YOU CANT BE FRAUD AND TAKING PEOPLES MONEY, especially in time like this. & HE HAD A FULL HOUSE OF PEOPLE, THE CRIB IS DIRTY I REPEAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BOOK FROM THESE PEOPLES"

The house is a bit far from Central Manhattan, it's situated almost at the end of the line 2 Uptown New York, but if you are on vacation you have the time to explore 


We would definitely recommend this stay!

Beds were comfy.    As other had stated the traffic noise is a bit tough in the bedrooms if your not used to it .   But your in tHe big city so what do you expect.     Stairs to get to the apartment could be a bit much for elderly or out of shape folks.   But We did fine.   Lots of places to walk to and see.   Great restaurants and vegan options for my hubby.    Sadly we were there during the beginning of the corona virus outbreak so there were less people out.    And it was a bit scary.   I’m praying that will go away very soon.    The rooftop deck was awesome to.  We loved it.   Our stay was great I’m ready to go back very soon after this virus crap is gone.  Praying for our world right now.

Easy going UWS (upper west side) neighborhood vibe and very close to several subway lines. You also have two delis (markets) on the corner, and you are nearby some of the best supermarkets in NYC. Full disclosure, I actually live 5 blocks away, so I may be biased! But I needed a nearby apartment for an extended period, and I’m so glad to have selected Lynn and Irene’s place. I was actually in a bit of a bind at the time, and they were really understanding and accommodating. The apartment is cute, and the tall ceilings give it an expansive feel. Also, it has a huge kitchen for a NYC apartment. And there were thoughtful snacks included. Best of all, they are clean freaks and very into the details, as am I...so that was important to me. It’s also important to me to get a big TV, and theirs didn’t disappoint. Thank you Lynn and Irene!"

The decor of the home made it feel very welcoming and Lynn went out of her way to leave yummy snacks for us. Both bedrooms had nice beds, one was super soft and the other was firmer, so you’ve got some options. The location was great there was a great bakery down the street and amazing Thai food. All in all I would stay here again with my friends, it was great. Oh I almost forgot the water pressure in the shower was perfection along with the shampoo and conditioner."

It's beautiful, very stylish/artsy, really cozy with fairy lights and lots of pillows -- you truly feel at home. The location is amazing, 2 blocks away from Central Park and 2 blocks away from Fairway (great supermarket). Lynn was a great host, greeted us, is very responsive, had snacks in the apartment, and there are full size bottles of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The kitchen is good for cooking simply; we enjoyed eating our meals at the kitchen bar area. The apartment is very clean and well maintained, with beautiful high ceilings. All in all, a great stay and I again highly recommend staying in this Upper West Side apartment!"

The building is secure, and your individual room has a lock/key, so as a single woman I felt safe there and my belongings were secure when I left. Lots of food/laundry options in the area, & right next to subway. Sharing a space with strangers was an interesting experience. The reason I can't give full stars is because I was there during the covid-19 outbreak and we had someone move in who was exposed to a positive case and had symptoms, and I felt the situation was handled poorly by the host. Communication was also problematic at times."

However the host is completely useless and his ‘friends’ who were the ones the guests and I had contact with could be very rude. A cleaning lady comes once a week and the apartment is very clean despite one or two dead cockroaches in the kitchen cupboards but that’s New York. I enjoyed my stay here as my roommates were lovely! But like I said, don’t expect anything from the host, he failed to provide basic necessities such as toilet paper and soap which for the price of the stay is pretty appalling. He also lacks communication. You’re basically renting out your own room in a lovely apartment, don’t expect any kind of Homestay experience."
"11566","38704145","620067402",2020-03-20,3200697,"Yekaterina","I stayed at Jack’s place for a week and had a really good time. It is only few minutes away from a subway stop and about 10 minutes walk to Prospect park. The apartment is on a second floor with it’s own entrance off the street, it is a typical park slope Brooklyn charm with some typical details. Clean bathroom, good size living room and two smaller bedrooms. Jack was very easy to communicate with and was always available. I highly recommend his place for a stay to visit one of the most unique neighborhoods of New York."
"11567","38704201","619415908",2020-03-17,340785604,"Drew & Stephanie","My daughter and I stayed in Sandy's lovely West Village apartment for four nights. Short version - loved it and would recommend. Long (Website hidden by Airbnb) is located on a quiet street just two blocks from Washington Park. A short walk to the corner rewards you with a great view of the Washington Arch. ""Check In"" was very simple - we picked up the key at a designated place and let ourselves in. The apartment building appeared very safe, clean, and well maintained. We were instructed to introduce ourselves as friends of Sandy and her husband if necessary. We did not encounter another resident the whole four days. The apartment itself was very welcoming, clean, and comfortable. It is a small space, but plenty of room for two people. Sandy had offered to put up a spare bed and divider in the living room for my daughter. I told her that wasn't necessary and I am glad that I did. An extra bed would have made it too cramped. The kitchen is tiny with beautiful finishes and full-sized appliances. The bedroom had plenty of room for the two of us with ample closet and drawer space. The bed and bedding were comfortable. The bathroom was small but nicely stocked and incredibly clean with beautiful finishes. I would imagine the bathroom might be tight for a larger person. Sandy's place was such a lovely, comfortable space, I hesitate to find fault, but I will mention just a couple of details that might matter to others. This is an older building and the floor in the bedroom creaks loudly. This may sound nit picky, but it was VERY loud in the middle of the night when either my daughter or I made a bathroom trip. It is really loud and might be an issue for others. Also, as far as natural light goes, there is plenty in the bedroom, but natural light in the living room is limited.  Would either of these things keep me from staying again or recommending to others? Not at all. Great apartment. Great host."

The Co-Host Michelle has such a warm and welcoming attitude that I couldn't but feel at home right away. Also, it was super clean, the bed comfortable (if not too comfortable since I faced hard times to get up :) ). The kitchen is well equipped, everyone has space in the fridge and shelf. The  neighborhood is calm, safe, diverse and friendly. There is a laundry right across the street, several supermarkets and the subway in walking distance. You can even go for a run along the East river if you feel like it. However, Queens/Astoria is a residential are, so don't expect thousands of bars, restaurants or cafes. The subway ride to Manhattan or Greenpoint is no distance, though! All in all, I can definitely recommend the place, and I am sad that I had to leave earlier than expected due to the current global situation.

I accidentally burned his pot one time (was boiling water), felt bad at about, wanted to pay him back/replace it, but he said it was fine. A great chef as others have mentioned. Came back from work tired and he offered me some of his chili and rice, it was indeed delicious! As a nurse myself, he was very accommodating to my needs during the Covid shelter-in, he gave and respected my privacy.  I would HIGHLY recommend his place to anyone and everyone!

The space was just what I needed, as I spent most of my days out and about in the City. Overall, there is great artistic charm about the building and the apartment. Sid was extremely helpful and responsive to any questions that I had - what a great host! 

The neighborhood is ideal - as it is close to everything in Midtown and also Hudson Yards, Penn Station, etc. There are many wonderful restaurants to grab food and drinks.  

I would recommend for anyone with a desire to be located centrally in the City, and who likes to spend a lot of time exploring."

The place is super clean; the common areas are disinfected every day. 

The bed was comfy. Four pillows and a warm blanket were provided in addition to a small portable heater.

My room had a big closet and shelves, making it easy to unpack and arrange my clothes/personal items.

Each room has a designated drawer in the fridge so guests can buy and store some groceries.

There's also a microwave to heat up your food.
Tea bags, sugar, disposable plates/cutlery were also provided.

The bathroom is spacious and stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body soap and toilet paper. 
We never ran out as they stocked them on a regular basis.

Communication with Sandra was fast and easy through the App.

Each guest is provided with a door code (no physical key for front door). You get a key for your room.

I loved staying there. Will be back again soon."

Just a couple of things that could be better: the people next door to us,(not sure if they were other bnb’ers), were pretty loud and were smoking. (It wasn’t cigarettes.) Also, the previous bnb’ers must have shaved and left their hair in the sink. There was no hand soap to wash my hands and the towel by the sink was filthy. Besides that it was still a great stay.

There's a shared kitchen upstairs but I didn't dare go up to inspect due to the condition of the room and bathroom. No working TV or internet access . The place smells like a dirty ashtray and the bedsheets were so filthy that the cleaning lady had replaced them with a lesser dirty/wrinkly sheet. Please pay a little bit more before booking this place. Also, I told the cleaning lady that I was stepping out to get some food and left my sister in the the room, as soon as I stepped out she let herself in the room to inform her that I'm the only one that needs to be present there.

The sheets seemed to smell and look as if they haven’t been washed in months, there wasn’t a kitchen to be a found like you described and there was literal trash all around the place. You need a full course of hospitality training or better housekeepers because the level of unprofessionalism I experienced last night, this place shouldnt even be considered a stay on Airbnb’s website let alone your family and I could give it no stars I definitely would.

The master bedroom had an issue with the window so it’d get cold in the morning but put the heat on before bed it’ll be nice and toasty. If the little things were fixed it’d be 100% perfect.

Irina was always VERY fast to respond to questions, which was very much appreciated.
I have never left anything negative in reviews for Airbnb, however I was disappointed in my stay due to the fact that for two weeks of my four week stay the refrigerator and freezer wreaked of stinky fish, making them unusable. I brought the issue up to Irina and was told it had been cleaned down several times and there was nothing else to be done. Obviously staying in an apartment for a month I needed access to a fridge. I was not given any alternative, so I was left to go buy cleaning supplies and scrub down every inch of the fridge and freezer. Unfortunately this did not remove the scent. I brought up the issue again, as the coronavirus pandemic was getting more serious and I needed a fridge to be able to store food. I explained to Irina I should have been made aware of the issue before checking in, even if it was the same day of checkin. I had inquired before booking this apartment about a fridge, as I hadn’t seen one in any photos, so the host knew this was important to me.
It wasn’t until I continued to persist that I needed a fridge that it was cleaned. I’m not sure how, as I scrubbed it down with vinegar and baking soda myself and it still smelled foul. 
I appreciate that I was finally able to use the fridge, however the first two weeks I had to eat all my meals out, or only eat non perishables, which added to expenses."

Some elements that would make it better:
1. Bed / mattress was uncomfortable and had an awkward slope (not level)
2. Drawers / closet space in the bedroom is needed vs only closets in the entrance hall
3. Apartment needs a washer / dryer - or there should be one in the building 

Location in downtown was convenient and we would be glad to stay again"

Cons: noisy helicopter landing right outside, horrendous check-in experience (Zeus forgot to leave the check-in instructions), forgot to leave the entrance key for resident, VERY busy elevators (expect to wait in lines and be stopped on at least 3-6 floors each ride), small unit tends to lack air circulation and get stuffy even with A/C on, expensive and faulty washers and dryers on 2nd floor"

Antoinette, Brandon and Blue the cat are all lovely and kind and we got along very well. I miss New York and staying with them already and will be back for sure! :)"

I booked the room and once it was confirmed I never got any information on how to get into the space from the host. I arrived late with my cousin and we waited in the cold calling and messaging the host over 20+ times to escape the cold. We even asked the neighbors if they had any idea of what was going on and no one knew who could help us. 
After about an hour we decided to leave and as we get into our vehicle someone calls to tell us that they work for the host and that he was having phone trouble. Because of the lack of communication I refused to further do any business with them and left. The person advised me I would receive a full refund due to their inconvenience just cancel the booking. However Airbnb holds me responsible on the app and indicates there would be no refund. Although they advised this was the sure way to receive my refund it clearly is not and when I showed them the issue he then texted me the code for the key box. At this point it was well after midnight and I was far gone from the property.  This host is tricky and deceitful please don’t even do it, it’s not worth it.  Through the window blinds we could see inside the place was dirty and disheveled as if the place had not been cleaned from the last occupants. 


Gross please don’t do it ."

"11780","39111018","620081296",2020-03-20,127865851,"Yarhiel","Such a great stay! We booked this unit for a spring break trip for 6 people. We had MORE than enough room for everyone and could’ve easily hosted more. This apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures. The unit was sparkling clean! Very bright space with minimal, simplistic (but comfortable) furniture. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics as far as plates, cups, cooking utensils, etc. and the Keurig was a godsend (we brought a reusable K-cup and our own coffee grounds, but there were k-cups provided)! 

Overall, very nicely sized space, especially for an apartment in Brooklyn, and it’s in a safe area. We had no concern regarding our safety walking around the area to the parks (Lincoln Terrace Park), subway and grocery stores, and everything is easily within walking distance. There is no designated parking, so that’s important to note, but we didn’t have any trouble finding street parking! The commute to the city vía subway was about 40 minutes to Lower Manhattan and about 55 to Midtown/Central Park area. When you’re tired after a long day, that seems like quite the trip, but overall it wasn’t excessively long of a ride and it was nice to walk around on Eastern Pkwy with all the little shops and restaurants to get to the Utica station. 

Eli and Chani were super sweet! Unfortunately, our trip was scheduled just as this craziness with the COVID-19 has blown up, so we ended up having to cut the trip short and leave abruptly, but they were still so accommodating (even bringing us some toilet paper within a couple hours of requesting it! ). We look forward to returning to NY after everything settles down and staying here again!"

So only 2 people can sleep in each full size bed. What did surprise me was the extra bathroom. There are 2 and 1/2 bathrooms. The sink in the half bathroom was in the way of using the toilet lol but we managed. We were familiar with the area so the location was everything. Stores are about 2 blocks north or 2 block East of the house. There was little things that kind of bothered us such as the water in the bathroom with the tub builds up it doesn't go down in the drain fast enough. Also, We wish there were more  cookware options.

Get a hybrid because it lasts longer. As a designer there’s great potential I see here for the host. You should def put two queens beds down there you would make more money. The area is quiet minus the constant walking over your head."

The room is so big and the bed super comfortable, please be kind because he is rapairing his house.
The location is perfect! we had no problem finding his house and we used the subway wich is less than 10 minnutes from his house.

The neighborhood is as described, and Fernando is willing to go that extra mile to make sure that his guess is well taken care of. I was able to call or text him at anything with a quick response back. He was able to make my stay very comfortable by providing suggestions of local places to shop, eat, and wash clothes. Under the present circumstances that we are going through with covid-19, this made all the difference. Comfortable, quiet, and just that what feel like good ol southern hospitality made my stay 5 star plus 1 if at all possible. I would say if you considering on stay here I would say don't hesitate because I know I will be again. Thanks again Fernando"

"11950","39253446","622863589",2020-04-21,96396168,"Rachel","We came during the Covid epidemic to help out in a local hospital ICU from a different state. 
There were several problems with the property including a non working TV and internet that we needed to complete medical records after work, a broken sofa with one leg cracked on the ground, a dirty oven that immediately started a smoke detector upon being turned on, an overheated apartment with a superintendent that would show up with a bang and lights on in a surprise shared hallway way after we were asleep after a long day in the hospital. Scared us a few evenings after dark. His cigarette smoke blowing through the door as well. 
However, the main problem and a reason not to rent from this host is not all of the above but rather his total indifference to address any of the issues. Promises were made. Internet was not fixed, sofa remained sitting in the floor with a broken leg, cleaning lady was never dispatched, and the superintendent kept popping up way after bed time hours. Despite being told a deep cleaning would occur, the super’s late night arrivals were inappropriate, etc. 
At a time when the whole city rose above and beyond what needed to be done, and showed everybody what it is made of, Joseph did not even bother to do the bare minimum that he could do, and blatantly so. We departed early and found a much better rental for the remainder of our time.
I would boycott his property out of principle, and find him to be a disgrace to people of New York."

I asked to move rooms and was shown the room I actually did reserve. It was not available until the following week.

I am a nurse and traveled to Brooklyn, NY for an assignment and had the pleasure of staying in James and Holly’s beautiful apartment. 

This apartment is spacious and cozy and had everything I needed especially for a longer stay. The living room is comfortable and well lit which was a perfect place to cozy up with a book. Or if you’re in the mood for entertainment they have a tv in both the bedroom and livingroom already set up with Netflix, Amazon, etc... I was able to cook easily in the kitchen with all the appliances and dish ware that was already in the apartment. But if you’re not in the cooking mood, the area has a surplus of amazing food! The bedroom is massive and comfortable and the bathroom again had everything I needed for my stay.... and can I mention the bathroom has heated flooring?! 

With everything the home provided, none of that compared to the hospitality James and Holly provided. They made sure I had everything I needed and were very quick to respond with any questions I had. Holly had great recommendations for food, wine and grocery in the area. 

It was hard to leave my home to come help out in New York and James and Holly  made the experience for me so much easier and better than I could’ve asked for. I only wish the circumstances weren’t what they were as I would’ve loved to have them over for dinner! 

I will and have already recommended this home to anyone looking to travel to New York and cannot wait to travel and stay with them again!"

Just said speak to Air BnB, but Air BnB is telling me all the time speak to the owner so they steal 700 $ from me.

High ceilings add very private entry to the apartment that is one of only 5 units in the building ( each unit is a whole floor).  Located on a bustling dynamic street in NYC that gives the apartment a great urban feel.  While the urban sounds can be heard at the front of the unit the main bedroom and kitchen area face the back side whee common space and an alley exist that is super quiet.  Highly recommend."

I was a solo traveler and found the location to be perfect for easy access to all attractions. The train station which is the 36th street station is very close by, about 6mins walk. The trains at that station practically take you everywhere and if it doesn't, the first station it stops at is  Barclays centre station where you can find any train that you would  need. There is also a very large gas station right  next door to the studio which was  very convenient as it has a large selection of food and drinks. I'm from the UK and wanted to take back alot of American snacks and although I did get some from Target, I did also purchase quite a few things from the gas station and they were pretty much the same price as Target. It's also nice to have it right next to the studio incase you feel peckish but there are other several restaurants and delis around. 

Although Jalena and her family live directly above the studio, I never once was intruded on, I appreciated the privacy and I wasn't disturbed at all. All communication was via the air bnb app. Check in and check out instructions were very clear and easy. I am so happy I chose this place for my New York adventure, it really was lovely coming back to this beautiful studio every day for a week after a long day of exploring. 

The studio was VERY clean and had everything you need. Several power outlets and also a USB outlet. This studio has been very thoughtfully designed to perfection. I also needed a full length mirror and Jalena kindly added this to the studio. She is always very quick to respond and extremely sweet and caring. You will not be dispointed with this place."

1. The front two bedrooms are basically over a fire station, so they are a bit loud with sirens. So are most spaces in nyc though. 
2. You cannot shower at the same time as others or you will run out of hot water. We asked our host several times to fix the issue which they attempted to, but I think its just a matter of how many people are using the showers. 
3. The master bedroom bed is ROCK hard."

Communicative and answered within a timely fashion! Also extremely helpful and understanding since i had to extend my stay.

The microwave is installed in the bathroom which felt really unhygienic. Packages delivered to the apartment were reportedly missing. Due to COVID, my flights were getting cancelled. I requested for an extension of 2 days and they were quick to agree and charged me money for it. My newly-booked flight got cancelled again and I requested to cancel the extension and asked for a refund the next day, and Sharedeasy completely dismissed my request based on their “30-day notice” policy. It felt very unfair for the company to do so, given that they made an exception to the 30-day policy when I requested for an extension and happily took my money, but when I asked to cancel that extension and a refund within less than 24 hours of paying for it, they said no. Note that this was at least 3 weeks ahead of the move-out date, so it is not by any means a last-minute notice from my end. On top of all the stress of living through a pandemic away from home, this felt like a very unfair response from the company’s management."

He never took longer than a day to answer a new inquiry - bringing an extra blanket, a kitchen utensile, fixing something... He's also a great company and roommate when he's there, with interesting discussions. Alan has been very flexible, during COVID-19, but also before. He is exactly what you can expect of an Airbnb host. If I had to come back to NY, I'll go back to his Airbnb, I can only highly recommend."

One bed is in the main living area and the second is in a small bedroom space with smoked glass doors that can be closed to separate the two. Overall a smaller unit but that was expected and is normal for the neighborhood - and was not an issue for us. Modern kitchen and bathroom with new appliances and fixtures. Older NYC-style radiator heat that gets VERY hot but can be controlled with a valve at the base of the radiator. One block from Houston Street and short walk to virtually everything in downtown Manhattan, great location. Good value and highly recommended!"

Emily is a great host, she was always helpful with tips about the city or anything that we needed in the house. The room is bigger than it looks in the photos, I stayed there for two months with my partner and we managed it pretty well. Because we were staying longer, Emily was so nice to giving us more space and a whole closet for our clothes outside the room.  The kitchen is well-equipped  and the living room has a really comfy couch. Overall we loved our experience and we would have liked to stay more."

His place is in a great location and it's incredibly easy to walk to things from or hop on the train. It was clean and comfortable. As a host, I've never felt more safe and secure in an AirBnb and I've used this service for a few years now. He is great and very quick with communication and incredibly welcoming. I stayed at his place when I was moving to NY and he could not have been more helpful! Book with Marv you won't regret it!"

What is you hosted a female? The constant noise and moving of tables at 4 am while knowing that someone was right below the main house was ridiculous. Your family is very nice and I'm sorry to have to say this but, the living situation/stay over situation is very unprofessional. There were ppl coming in my room when I wasnt there to go in that back closet. I rented that room. The shower fires off at the door immediately and if you turn it another direction it soaks the floor. I'm sorry but I contacted Air BNB about this from day one."

Location is more than perfect, it’s not far from 86 street station (you can use the 83 street exit to save some time too). Amazing NYC ferry is located in 500 m from the Appart and you can be in Financial district in 20-25 minutes admiring the views of Manhattan.

Host was contacted on how to access entry but gave no solution. Thankfully there were residents entering who let us in. Once we finally made it inside we were pleased to see that it was a lovely, not too closed in but yet intimate apartment. However, when my boyfriend went looking for the bathroom he did come across a roach on the closet door that quickly escaped through a crack which was a little concerning for us. Later on that night I came across another one in the middle of the night. When we uncovered the comforter off of the bed there were also strands of hair attached to the bed sheets that made me wonder whether the sheets were ever washed and whether there was someone recently lying there before us. Thankfully we carried our own towels and blankets. There weren’t any instructions on how to turn the heater on but we managed to figure it out. I would recommend this room seeing that it did have potential, host just needed to double check room first. I do advise that you confirm with host about ANY concerns of cleanliness before booking."

While Marissa wasn’t there, her parents live in the same building, and were always available if I needed help, needed a package sent, etc. They even had a house keeper come and clean the apartment/change the sheets in the middle of my stay, which was a touch I really appreciated! I was in NY on business and needed my car, and I always found a spot on the street or the block over.

The location was convenient, near pharmacies, supermarkets, liquor stores and centrally located between Central Park and the east side, which was great for a daily walk or a jog. The building’s amenities were great but unfortunately due to the pandemic, the exercise room, indoor pool and terrace were closed. The card laundry room was clean and organized. The only inconvenience was the fact the the building is near hospitals so the sirene is a normal daily thing and also the homeless people walking around the subway station asking for money. Other than that, it’s a lovely place! We loved the kitchen, where we could cook our meals since ordering food was a bit hard. The king size bed was very comfy but we thought the AC unit was a bit noisy. 
Great location, close to 2 subway stations and walking distance to everything we needed. They are prompt in responding to any concerns we had. 
We would definitely stay there again. 
Thank you!

Due to the corona virus outbreak I had to leave my home because  my father is elderly and high risk. Since I had to continue working I couldn't take the chance. I found Alex's apartment in Greenpoint, it looked nice from the photos and I know that the area is really safe. Alex quickly responded and I was ready to go the next day. The entrance/ hallway leading to the apartment was very dark, I almost didn't want to go in but I made my way up to the apartment. The apartment was neat but not very clean. It took me about 2 hours to wipe everything down and clean. The apartment smelled like cigarettes, Alex said the people who stayed there before me smoked inside the apartment. I didn't want to make a fuse because Alex did apologize about it and it wasn't his fault. My second day at the apartment, I kept hearing running on the roof, I suspected it was an animal of some sort but Alex assured me it was construction workers. Late that night I saw a MOUSE in the kitchen. I was so frightened that went to the master bedroom to grab some of my things and saw another mouse run out from under the bed. I literally grabbed my suitcase and ran out. Thankfully one of my friends was up (it was almost midnight) and I was able to stay with her. I reached out to Alex that night but I didn't hear back from him till the morning via text, although I did ask him to please call me. I let him know I would be going back for the rest of my things. I went back nervous but quickly got my things and made sure everything was as neat as when I walked in. I was disappointed that Alex did not offer a resolution (possibly calling an exterminator)  or a refund. I found myself in a very difficult situation. I escalated this to Customer Care, and they have been amazing in assisting me. I truly hope that Alex has resolved the issue and had the apartment looked at. I would hate for anyone else to have the experience I did."

It was extremely disappointing to get to the building and be greeted with locked doors, no lights and no staff to contact. We called multiple times and it was very stressful having to rebook the same day. One of the things that really upset me was the lack of communication. It was unfortunate to have to travel all the way to our hotel to realize there was absolutely no one inside and had to reach out to Airbnb for them to contact the host, which in return cancelled, still without a notice. We were excited to stay here but now we are not sure if we would ever try to rebook at this establishment again."

I will never forget his offering me a packet of gloves and several masks for safety.
This unforgettable stay was drawn out due to onset of Covid-19. 
My room, private bath and use of kitchen could not have been more accommodating for the situation.
Host graciously agreed to several extention adjustments.

The apartment has been newly renovated, and thoughtfully accessorized for the traveler. I appreciated it’s cleanliness and uncluttered simplicity.
Bed is comfortable, desk with reading lamp and rack for clothing were very useful.
Ridgewood is an interesting, diverse, and emerging art community. 
Across the street, fantastic Billy’s Market, with a vast variety of grocery items, kept me well supplied through quarantine.
Train station location, transport to Manhattan & boroughs quick and convenient.
5 stars for staying at Joey’s"

"12390","39869844","618008547",2020-03-14,104643803,"Kirsten Reintje","It was the first time I choose a shared appartement. It was way better than I expected. We really felt at home. Salvador and Juliana treat you as friends/family. We started the day together at the breakfast table with coffee, talking about our plans for that day. They shared a lot off tips with us. Salvador makes his own bread, so you wake up with the smell of freshly baked bread. When they had friends over for diner and we arived home, they invited us to sit with them. The last night they cooked us an amazing meal. It was the perfect ending to say goodbye. If you are social and like to get to know people and their culture.. You will really enjoy your stay here. 
Salvador and Juliana are home a lot, working from home, making art with a 3d printer. Still they are really quiet when you are at home. We never had to be at the same time in the bathroom, I think they take it into acocount. The place is very clean. The bed was heaven, we really slept like a baby. The towels where also hotelquality. The street is a bit noisy, but after a whole day spent in Manhatten you sleep through it. Its near to the metro (3min) and for us it was the perfect location. We also wanted to explore Brooklyn (Williamsburg, Dumbo). If you want to explore Harlem and the upper east side it will take you a 50min/1h travel time. The metro goes almost every 5mins so you can travel quickly into manhatten.
Tips:
1) Go see 'the moulin rouge' (broadwayshow) and a professional basketballgame (we went to the nets/Barclays Center). Go to the gutter for some old school bowling when its raining.
2) Breakfast/Lunch: B-cup, the bedford, hutch & waldo cafe, Joseph Leonard, Pitanga, big daddy's, Lexington Candy Shop
3) Diner: thursday kitchen (My favorit!), Rubirosa, Monomono
4) Jazzbar: Peppi's cellar, Tomi Jazz
5) Cocktailbar: Peachy's
6) Rooftopbar: CloudM
6) Juiceshop: Juice generation"
"12391","39870438","619436022",2020-03-17,333428635,"Mike","This is my first Airbnb stay and I couldn’t imagine a better experience. Francesco immediately made me feel like home and was extremely helpful with local tips and guidance. 
The room has an amazing bed so I slept really well, and Francesco’s professional espresso machine (that was provided as a free service!!) is a great way to start your morning. Shower is blasted with any kind of soap there is and you’ll need and the house and room is generally just filled with sweet gestures like chocolates and snacks. It is clear that for Francesco hosting on Airbnb is more than just a job.
About the area-the neighborhood is really cool with many good restaurants and clubs like house of yes and the Brooklyn mirage so you could really do so many things without even leaving the area. Subway station is literately across the street (a 20 seconds walk) and it will take less than 15 minutes to get to the center of Manhattan.
I think this is the best value you could get for you money in a New York Airbnb. Truly recommended!!!!"

We needed a place to stay quickly as our home was under renovation and the work was put on pause due to the COVID19 outbreak in NYS. As Gigi and Daniel’s FIRST guest, they worked with us and got in quick and smoothly. The stress free and smooth process made me feel safe, which was my top priority as I moved in 7 months pregnant and with a young child. Not only did we have a lovely host but a space with lots of new amenities such as the bathroom, bright lighting, bedding and comfortable furnishings. We would absolutely recommend the space to our friends and family, when they come to visit us again, which we hope is soon!"

I loved spending 3 months here as the flat is so homely. It had all accounts on the tv to watch any favourite TV shows and the big kitchen was great to cook in. 

It’s situated on a quiet street and being on the top floor it has great privacy/ security. 

Rodney and management were a text away in case I needed anything and were responsive to any questions. Brooklyn was a great area to stay, you are 2 metro stops away from Williamsburg in which has some amazing rooftop bars / shopping. Bed-stuy also has some great local restaurants, cafes and fitness classes.   
Would highly recommend!"

The place definitely looks as it does in photos but if you're anything like me, the inside does not look as good as it appears. The first thing I noticed was spillage and old food, in the fridge. Although, the host offered to come back and clean after she had left, I declined and decided to clean it for myself. On top of that, my guests and I spent majority of our first day cleaning the entire house from top to bottom. The sheets in the bedrooms were stained/dirty, the kitchen was filthy (stovetop, sink, counter, fridge, oven), and none of the kitchenware like the pans, pots, etc were appealing enough to cook in nor use. Everywhere else was fairly clean but we proceeded to clean anyway, as extra precaution. The worst part was having to spend my own money to wash the sheets provided in the dingy, little laundry room in the basement– which should have been freshly washed already. However, it was a nice area and the place/neighborhood was pretty quiet. Overall, I made the best out of my stay."

The space was just as advertised—-a super comfortable very large room by NYC standards that was easily accessible and in a good neighborhood which still retains a lot of the charm that NYC used to have in excess.  He was very welcoming of my dog and did his best to make it a great stay.  Very much reccomended——"

When i arrived the key was not under the mat like i was informed. I knocked on the door a man was inside, he informed me that he was the host cousin and he is doing his laundry and cleaning but we can enter. I told him when he’s finished to let us know and we will come in i am a female, rape is real i was not trying to go inside however i had bags so i went in. He said he will leave soon but he was doing his laundry. I asked him for the keys he took it out his pocket but he was very rude and didn’t even engage to even look at me when giving me the keys as if I’m not suppose to get the keys. Then i had a cake he looked at me and said “i hope you’re not having a party in here” so i responded “i am not having a party in here” he responded “ never said you was I’m saying i hope you’re not, i hope you follow the rules” that is very disrespectful why would i have a party in somebodies place especially during these times. He kept walking pass us back and forth we didn’t even feel comfortable to even speak in there. Then he informed me he will come back for his clothes later in the washing machines as if i booked a laundromat. Then to top it all off the place smelled like smoke, now how are you telling me not to have a party but you’re smoking out the house? That place is just horrible and if you’re a women please don’t book for your own safety. Still haven’t gotten back my refund or an update about my refund.

You tell me the place is going to be empty just for me have me pay extra but your cousin is there that is a male and you know i am a female. Smh terrible terrible terrible DO NOT BOOK."

I came here to help out with COVID19 as a nurse traveling 17 hours away. My room was given to someone else by mistake. Waited 2 hours to get a different room assigned. I was placed in a dirty unit/dirty room because everything else was taken. Old expired food that was left from previous tenants in the kitchen/fridge. I had to clean everything myself! I was promised laundry “keys” to get access to the basement downstairs, which is where the laundry room is located. Never received them. Days later, I was told I had to download an “app” to get access. Therefore, I was left with 2-3 loads of dirty work clothes to do somewhere else. The lights in the hallway inside the unit didn’t work. MOLD in various parts of the unit, especially the bathroom! “Wet” malodorous smell lingering from the room. One of the bathroom is also very small that your head will literally touch the sink while you’re sitting on the toilet! In addition, Very SQUEAKY floors as you’re walking around.  Messaged the building “manager” who gave us the keys various times about issues and always got a response days later, and he still didn’t address the issues. Nina was not understanding at all and took no accountability for ANYTHING & claimed was “never” informed."

Quiet, spacious, clean and convenient. The place is very welcoming and open to the outside while maintaining privacy and quietness. The windows in the living gives to the street, but you rarely hear any noise and the trees that are close to the apartment gives the place a green and healthy atmosphere. We used the air conditioning during the last few days which was effective and relatively quiet for a windows A/C. The separate kitchen is really convenient. 
Most important for the two months I stayed in J’s apartment is the host who is an amazing person, compassionate, and extremely empathetic. 
Bottom line ...zero issues and a highly positive experience."

"12534","40056866","623803386",2020-05-03,47625350,"Adale","I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE WITH AIRBNB UNTIL THIS.

Seth Paine tried to coerce me out of money that he claimed was due to the way I left the apartment. I told Seth before booking the Airbnb, that I would be staying alone for the most part, but at some point guest would show up, as my friends wanted to throw me a 
small birthday get together. He said it was okay as long as I mind the neighborhoods and clean up. We both agreed that for a night, 8-10 people max was fine. I have proof of that conversation. My friends and I, when they arrived, played UNO cards, ate cupcakes, and watched MTV's Wildin' Out over some Corona beers. Thats it. 

HAD HE NOT TOLD ME IT WAS FINE, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOOKED HIS PROPERTY.

I cleaned from 8am to 12pm as the cleaning people arrived on my last day because I believed that I was helping. I wiped the place down clean, threw out all the trash I had and left BARE MINIMUM work because although I payed a cleaning fee, I also take GREAT CARE of my airbnb's. In response, Seth told me that I needed to PAY HIM ""for another day"" because I stayed until 12:54, instead of 12pm, CLEANING WITH HIS CLEANING PEOPLE. 

I told him that was ridiculous, and he could ask the cleaning people to confirm that all of my things were packed and by the door, and I was inviting them in as I pushed out bags of garbage when they arrived.

He then went on to send me a photo of a large paper that was over the window when I arrived that I had removed, as if that was something I should pay him for. It was like a large sticky note put up as a drape blocking the windows. I had no idea he expected me to keep it over the windows the entire time. How would I  get fresh air or see outside? All I did was fold it and carefully place it behind the door of the room. I told him to simply put it back up. When he realized that wasn't a crime and there was nothing wrong with it, he started looking for anything he could find to accuse me of, so that I would pay him extra money.

He then sent a photo of some markings on the floor that he said was done with ""paint"". I told him there was absolutely no way that there was paint on the floor. To which he sent me a photo of thin, pen-like, line markings on the floor. What he saw was faded color from hair strands that fell from my freshly colored hair I dyed 2 weeks before. So the hair strands that fell on the floor left their print. IMAGINE THAT. He called it ""paint"". I told him to simply have the cleaners CLEAN that spot and it would be removed. 

THEN, he sent me a video of what he described as ""A clogged sink"".  I told him that the sink worked fine, and I know because the last thing I did was wash my hands. I told him that there are pipe cleaners such as drano that simply unclog drain pipes, if it really somehow became clogged after I left. I then told him to stop texting me so that we can just handle this through Airbnb, and if it needs to escalate I would be happy to oblige.

I was so careful and it seemed like the stuff he was showing me was so asinine. He was looking for something, ANYTHING, and I'm disheartened at this experience.

When it became clear to him that I was certain that I didn't cause any problems, he suggested that I give him money. I told him that we should handle this through Airbnb and let them investigate. I refused to give him money under the table or off-line, especially because everything he tried to scare me with didn't make sense. I had witnesses, I was careful, I have great history with all my host, and I knew I could prove that I didn't do any harm.  

I have been using airbnb for years to travel the world, and this incident breaks my heart because I would've been in a different country if it wasn't for the virus, and Seth ruined my trip and is now trying to ruin my reputation with airbnb. 

I left the place better than I came, cleansed it with incense and lysol to make sure it didn't have the same smell it had when I first arrived. 

I will be reporting the coercion to airbnb. I was intimidated and threatened, but I stood up for myself because I know I left Seth's place in tip top shape."

I walked into town to buy groceries and it took about 30 minutes each way by an intentionally meandering route.

Unfortunately, because of the recent pandemic, we had to immediately leave after the first week. My girlfriend fell sick and we had to return home before the flights stopped operating. We explained this to Fiki and tried to negotiate the amount to be refunded. But we were very disappointed with how she handled the situation. She refused and eventually stopped replying. 
It would’ve really meant a lot if she would’ve been more understanding. Overall, the apartment is nice for a couple."

"12580","40143944","625502945",2020-05-21,30613366,"Viara","The good: Communicating with B was a great experience, she was quick, detailed, and courteous in her replies, and booking was easy. The apartment was a block away from Central Park and a number of food shops, which was phenomenal. There was parking in the area around the apartment. Bed sheets smelled fresh and are soft. 
The bad: The photos show the apartment in its best light - however, the photos don't show the ""whole picture"" to include the places and items that are not kept up with. In reading previous reviews and seeing the listed pictures, my expectations of the place were built up rather high and were unfortunately let down by reality. I booked the apartment expecting a home away from home in the city, but in reality I found a place which has a lot of potential but is in need of many updates and attention. 
Issues: The couches and couch pillows are shabby (black one is sunken in), and stained. The bathroom floor tile is in disrepair and broken. The tub and tile wall has limescale/mildew build-up, and there is a hole in the ceiling next to the shower head. (All of this discouraged us from utilizing the shower.) The toilet seat is made of foam and has a hole in the seat. The windows and tv are covered in dust and have not been wiped in what seems to be a long time and the apartment itself smelled like an old movie theater. The bed is sunken in the middle, and makes guests wonder how old it is and how many people have slept on it. The oven is a hazard - gas keeps running even when the knob is turned off. The light next to the black couch is ripped and the curtain rod is falling off the wall in the living room. Wifi is super slow and kept cutting off. I had to unplug it several times to reconnect and ended up using my own data after getting frustrated with it. Apple TV did not work - kept cutting off connection and was in Spanish. (I reset it to English, but it cut off and went back to Spanish on its own.) Towels are old. 
Given all these factors, I wouldn't say the rental is accurately represented in the listing."

But I have three complaints.

First, she has repeatedly told me that your flight was canceled by the new coronavirus and the airport is very busy, so it would be better to go to the stopover(Detroit) by bus on Friday evening, but my flights on Saturday morning were not canceled and the airport was not crowded at all. She also said she was planning to return to the southern area on Friday. So I felt that she wanted me to leave Airbnb on Friday to go back home as planned. It was very disappointing. 

Second, I'm not sure what she was doing, but the living room was full of paper waste. There were plenty of things on the table, and there was even no space to eat in living room. I thought she does not care much about her customers.

Third, I have now charged $ 67 for repairs of the bed. She claims that the wheels and frame have been broken. However, when I checked the photos, the wheels do not come off and the frame was not cracked up. The wheels have already moved poorly since we checked in, and the only one part of fraim is off, which you can fix easily with a screwdriver. 

The location is very good and the host is basically a good person, but I felt she is self-centered and does not care about her guests so much. 
I have no intention of arguing with her on this comment. 
The next time I go to New York, I will stay at another place."

The place is great for events and there where somethings I would be mindful of. If your having a lingerie party let Shannon know in advance you want privacy. Shannon is at the location unless you see him leave. I had to clean the home as if it were my own especially during the pandemic, besides that I had a blast my pics/vids are amazing. Shannon allow you to turn the place into whatever you desire I truly love that part about his home he also has an amazing music equipment that is easy to use no need to bring any speakers or aux cords he has that part completely covered."

There was a few issues when I first arrived, but were promptly fixed without hassle. 3 bedrooms and one bath, the apartment does stay rather warm even with ac running and 50 outside. Nice area though. Within walking distance to stores and Times Square. I specifically asked about parking prior to getting rental and was told it’s ok to park our front when available. But was not told illegal to park out front from 8a-6pm which means I had to pay for parking daily. Parking is really the biggest downfall, you’re close to the water, close to stores, plenty of delivery options and close to time square. I’d definitely recommend."

We really enjoyed being able to relax on the screened in patio in the backyard, and spent a lot of time there. The kitchen is small but it has everything you need and we were really happy to have a washer and dryer included as well. Everything worked very well for our needs. We had a small issue with the refrigerator during our stay, but it was immediately fixed once we brought the problem up and cooled better than ever! If we had any questions or concerns Mike was very quick to get back to us, which we thought a lot of.

The apartment itself is a simple NYC experience--nothing extravagant--but its location is really what counts. It's in my favorite part of Williamsburg and has rooftop access, which was really great for the one summery night I was there. 

I will say the bathroom is quite small and the kitchen is a little quirky, but that shouldn't stop you. The bed I slept in was so, so comfortable. Oh, and the lockbox situation was so easy, which I was grateful for.

Because I didn't see the kitchen information clearly at the beginning, there was a dispute after I checked in, but I quickly helped to solve it. My room is very spacious and sunny, the surroundings are very beautiful and quiet. Shopping and subways are very special. Everything is better than expected. Only a few aspects are the problem exists, there is no kitchen, if the long-term residence or guests want to cook their own that should consider. There is also that I live in the second floor WIFI is a little weak, if can improve is the best. Finally, I would like to thank LAN again and again for coordinating my time to arrange for me to stay, because the flight ticket for crown pneumonia has been cancelled continuously. Feel like a friend's support. Look forward to coming back here again. The people who work here are also very friendly."

The rooms themselves are small (just space for the bed and dresser) and not super sound-insulating, but comfortable. The projector in the living room is really nice for chilling and watching a movie.

It's a studio, but more spacious than I anticipated from the pictures, with everything you need for both working and lounging (desk, coffee table that pops up so you can eat while watching TV).  The apartment also gets pretty good light particularly in the afternoon.  It's on the second floor of a nice building AND has an elevator--a huge plus in a city full of 6th floor walkups! 

Danielle was a fantastic host and made sure I had everything I needed during my 3-week stay. While there wasn't much by the way of cooking utensils (chalk it up to years of Manhattan living!), when I texted her asking if she could provide any, she quickly borrowed the items from the nearby apartment where she was staying and brought them to me. I unfortunately had to head back home in the middle of my stay due to the country-wide shutdown starting, and Danielle graciously offered to put me back up again for the remainder of my original stay when I'm able to come back. I can't wait to return to Danielle's place!"

People taller than 5'10"" will have issues because of the low ceilings but for our length of stay it wasn't an issue  (i'm 5'8""). The access to the backyard was lovely, and to me any private outdoor space feels like a little luxury. The kitchen was well equipped with various pot and pans, utensils, mason jars, and simple seasonings. The use of a washer and dryer, right outside the apartment unit was incredibly convenient, and is an amenity of the 3 or4 unit building. And i personally loved her coffee table books-- which is just what you need when you're forced to stay indoors. I recommend this cute, well priced space."

The kitchen was equipped with everything you'd need - we prefer to cook at home than eat out every day, and often find the so-called 'well equipped' kitchens listed in many Airbnb apartments somewhat lacking. This was definitely not the case here. In the same way, the bathroom was well stocked with a note telling us to help ourselves to anything we need - a very thoughtful touch. 

The location was also fantastic: pretty much all the shopping, restaurants, bars and coffee shops you could want can be found a few minute's walk away. Likewise the subway, as well as Washington Square Park. 

All in all, I highly recommend Berenice’s place."

"12788","40374012","618043348",2020-03-14,62504068,"Keith","Mixed feelings about this one. Overall it was average......a cool little place in a GREAT (Website hidden by Airbnb) a price that seems the going rate in Manhattan. The entrance and common parts are gloomy and very underwhelming, whilst the apartment itself is tastefully done and very clean.

I guess the biggest downside was that when you first walk in, you really feel you are walking into an occupied apartment. I do a lot of Airbnb; my partner and our good friend are both Superhosts. I ""get"" Airbnb and have a lot of experience with it. In this place every closet and every drawer was filled with clothes and no attempt had been made to provide space for hanging or folding clothes for guests....I ended up squeezing my hanging clothes into the packed closets. The rest of my stuff I kept in my suitcases for 4 days days rather than disturb the private contents of all the drawers. When guests are paying $250+ a night, there's something very wrong if they feel like they are intruding in someone else's space.  
There was lots of provisions in the kitchen cupboards and fridge, but no mention of whether the tea,coffee, sugar etc was to be touched. An offer of milk, sugar and tea/coffee would have been appropriate, as would a kettle/microwave.
As a tall man, I could just about stand up straight in the main room. But on the mezzanine bedroom, that was impossible. Moreover, the steps up to the mezzanine would be totally unsuitable for someone elderly or frail.
The crazy hissing radiator is something the host is aware of and needs fixing. It's annoying.
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) overall feeling is that with a little bit of extra thought and empathy, this could have been (Website hidden by Airbnb) it was, it was OK."

I tried turning in the air and every time it seemed to get increasingly hotter.  

throughout the apartment there we remnants of smoking equipment and on the rules it clearly stated it wasn’t aloud. so for me seeing that I was somewhat surprised to see all of the objects. 

also the tenants we very strict and understand certain rules, but to me I could’ve even go outside and smoke a cigarette. if I did the neighbors would complain or the owners would send a warning about my stay. right in front of this specific property, there was a plethora of trash coming from a party/get together. so a lot of things were semi confusing."

For starters the previous occupants of the space were barely cleaned up after (Bed sheets and shower were dirty). The shower flooded because of the hair that was left there, DISGUSTING. The ""house"" is an apartment that is in between two other apartments. The upstair neighbors were great, and so were the neighbors in the rest of the neighborhood. But with the neighbors from downstairs, no noise could be made, and it got to the point where they shut our power off because we were ""making too much noise"" even though we were being gentleman the entire night. The music we played wasn't loud, and we respected everyones space. Would not come back to this place. Horrible experience."

The apartment is really clean, the decorations and small touches really make it look decorative, but spacious and open at the same time. I was actually surprised at how big the space felt and enjoyed being able to walk around the home and find areas where I could relax or sign on for work.

If you are planning on using the kitchen a lot there's definitely sufficient pots and spices, and a lot of fridge space! You can pretty much find everything you need, but if you do cook a lot like I do I would suggest maybe bringing some additional cooking utensils (but most likely you'll be out and about enjoying the city and eating outside so you'll definitely have everything you need if that's the case)!

The bathroom was clean and simple. And most importantly had good HOT WATER. That might seem like a given, but if you've ever lived in NYC apartments before, that's definitely an issue at times and I am happy to say we had no problems with that here. Additionally, there were towels available for us in the apartment along with essentials like toilet paper and napkins. 

One thing I will say is that the apartment was a bit cold, but Angel had a portable heater available which helped tremendously (keep it on the lower settings so it doesn't overheat). Since most NYC apartments in the Bronx and other areas use radiators to distribute heat it didn't surprise me so I'm glad we had the heater. Obviously not a problem during the summer.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here. Angel was also prompt in his responses and communication. Would definitely recommend others book!"

Communication was fantastic especially given the current circumstances surrounding travel & Veerle was very adaptable to our check in & check out. The space was perfect & so much better than a hotel room that would have been double the cost. Would recommend this as a place to stay."
"12861","40491431","620863079",2020-03-25,899777,"Holly","This is THE place to stay in NYC. Trust me and quit searching. If you're lucky enough to find Faz' place available, book it immediately. Here's why: 

First, the apartment itself. It's bigger, more beautiful, and better equipped than any place you'll find at a comparable price in the city. The decor is gorgeous—modern, simplistic, and super comfortable. The bed is a dream and the couch, chairs, and barstools are all wonderful. You'll have every amenity you need—including your own washer and dryer, which is hard to come by in NYC. The luxe kitchen is a pleasure to cook in, and the Nespresso machine means you'll start every morning right. There's plenty of storage space in the bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen, and the heater/AC and wifi work perfectly. The photos in the listing don't show this, but the bedroom and living room have huge windows, so the apartment is bathed in natural light. The building's front desk is staffed 24/7 with a friendly and helpful crew, and you can easily and securely receive deliveries. I highly recommend using FreshDirect for groceries—very convenient, fresh, and reasonably-priced groceries delivered to your door.

Beyond the building, the neighborhood is an ideal base for exploring and experiencing  NYC. You're on the western edge of Hell's Kitchen, in easy walking distance of numerous delicious restaurants and cozy wine bars. If you like to run or walk, you can reach the Westside Highway greenway or Central Park within minutes. If you have business or shopping needs in Midtown, you're also a short walk away. Columbus Circle is also close by, with subway connections to the rest of the city. I'm a solo female traveler and love to walk everywhere, and I felt safe and comfortable walking around the neighborhood day and night.

What makes this place more special than most is the host himself. Fadel (Faz) is one of the most communicative, caring hosts I've ever met. We actually have yet to meet in person (he rents out his space while he travels, thus we were not in the city at the same time), but I feel like we will be friends for life! He takes care to get to know potential guests in advance of renting to them, which only makes sense—after all, he is renting out his home. He then takes care to make certain you have all the necessary details and support to make your stay as comfortable and convenient as possible. He truly goes above and beyond in looking after his guests—even from very far away. 

Truly, I felt so at home in Faz' apartment that I did not want to leave. I only hope it's available again next time I visit the city. Thank you, Faz, for providing such a wonderful experience!"

He denied refunding when I asked him to, due to I had to leave the apartment in advance (10 days before) together with my family due to COVID-19 impacts (specifically airports closure and flights cancellation) and let him know that. He showed zero empathy, just cared about the thousands of dollars he kept in his pocket.  Considering that user experience is what really makes the difference, I would qualify him below zero."

The room is comfy with a spacious bed and enough space and furniture to store all your stuff, the appartment is very clean and well equipped, and the location is great as it's just a some blocks away from a Whole Foods Market and a Trader's Joe.
Brian, the host, is very nice and quick to respond to any issue or request you might have.

Warmly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality stay in Manhattan."

The listing was seemingly misleading as there was no hand soap in the space, bugs in the kitchen and bathroom, and the building entrance area needs a heavy sweeping, airing out, and paint job. 
A great place for a budget traveler who will be spending a lot of time outside of the space exploring the city."

Oh My God, I just still can’t believe what I went through with this horrible host… I was supposed to stay here for 40 days and all of a sudden, without any notification in advance or explanation of the situation or apology, the host ordered me to leave the place in next 20 hours because he and his family needed the place(?!), and make sure the place should be cleaned and sanitized(?!?!, these are direct quotes from the messages). Furthermore, he literally threatened by saying “I WILL THROW OUT ALL YOUR STUFF”, “AND WILL KICK YOU OUT LIKE A DOG” (both are exact quotes). He never was responsive and was able to be reached out throughout staying.

Aside from its horrible cleanness, bugs in the fridge, 8 inches of frost on the wall of the fridge and freezer which was not working and damaged all my frozen foods, heater not working, poor locks of all windows(can be open from outside), and incredible unresponsiveness of the host, it is important to note that it’s all about your safety to not stay here, especially when you think of the risk you can be exposed to COVID-19.

You should also keep in mind that, in this situation, Airbnb is the last thing you can depend on. They literally DISAPPERAED and did NOTHING but gave huge disappointment showing irresponsibility."

When I got upstairs Bree was there she is by far the most amazing woman I’ve ever met. She made sure the place was clean and she also went to target to get me some sugar for my coffee. I felt so welcome when I was there I had direct contact with everyone while I was there and if I could deal with the cold I’d honestly have signed a lease ha!

Clean, all the amenities listed were provided, easy check-in and check-out, good communication.  Only issue were the 3 flights of steps going up to the apartment.  Alot if you have to bring up alot of belongings.  We did know beforehand about the steps.  Badal informed us.  The building was in a nice area and always found parking.  Would definitely stay at Badal's place again."

"13030","40616285","622461597",2020-04-15,10164487,"Trasonia","When I got there, the building’s elevator was out so Abdul made multiple trips to the 5th floor with my bags and the groceries I’d brought with me. He then returned to encourage/coach me up five flights as I walk w/a cane.

Once in the apartment, he gave me a tour of all spaces & amenities (as they were plentiful) and explained how to use everything & how his team disinfects the entire unit and linens between guests.

Everything was as or better than expected - toiletries in the bath, coffee for the Keurig, dishes, cutlery, cookware, colander, coffee press, ample recycle bags/bins, smart TV with access to your Netflix, Hulu, Prime accounts, soft, pristine bedding, walk-in closet... ALL squeaky clean

I’d say the apartment was just like home but I don’t even HAVE a coffee press at home. I LEARNED how to make French press coffee at Abdul’s. ;o)

Not only is the space all you could possibly want, Abdul has elevated hosting to an art. He’s kind, thoughtful and truly cares about the wellbeing of all of his guests. He messaged to check on me hours after check-in, the next day to make sure everything was ok and periodically just to be sure all was well. 

He shares all needed & helpful information you could possibly use and is so kind, it’s like you have a friend there even though you’ve left yours back home. This guy literally brought me Ferrer Rocher chocolates during a pandemic...TWICE.

I could go on but you get the point. Truly the BEST AB&B stay and Host EVER - hands (Website hidden by Airbnb) I am truly thankful for."

His place is situated in a perfect part of Astoria. 2 blocks and you are on 30th Ave and have a choice of whatever you want to eat, drink or shop for.  Again kudos to the host Abdul. My hat is off to you sir and thank you for being such a pleasant and gracious host."

I come once or twice a year on business and like to eat and drink in both the East Village and the Lower East Side. This place is right at the border, just off Houston St, but on a quiet street without noisy interruptions at night. There is a lot of space by New York standards, and a nice amount of privacy between the two bedrooms. I would definitely stay here again."

The apartment itself is really nice. Perfect for two people, we stayed here for two months. It was clean, and well, not super spacious but that's just New York. The apartment had a good layout with a nice living room and extra lounge area.

Communication with the host was quick and easy!"

Much was closed due to the pandemic, but we still had groceries, excellent pizza, and great Thai food just steps away.

The apartment was spotless and warm during some cold days.  It is elegantly decorated, and both beds are so comfortable!  The building is very quiet.  My only tip is that the curtains are not blackout, so you might want to bring an eye mask if you plan on sleeping in.

Loraine is a true friend.  I did not meet her in person, but she planned our arrival and stay meticulously, was instantly available for any needs, and checked on us often.  I really do hope to get the chance to have her host us again."

I said it was my birthday and she immediately began orchestrating a lie about how her cleaner had the day off and she didn't  feel comfortable  letting people in the house until its clean because of covid so she has to cancel.  I say fine cancel it and she says ok but if it takes too long that I should do it.  I try to cancel and it says I wont get a full refund.  2 hours later I still get no refund. 
I text her back, no response. Come to find out she never even tried to cancel and eventually she tells air bnb that I said I want to throw a party.  Now I have to wait 2 weeks to get my refund and my birthday weekend was ruined.  Fuck this stupid hoe and her funky ass apt.  I hope she gets covid and chokes on a dirty dildo."

There is a walk in closet with racks for hangers but other than that it is a bare walk in closet (no drawers). There are no other furnitures in this unit. I stayed here for 2 months but in spite of all these missing furnitures I was comfortable mainly because I am at work 5 days a week and just use the space to sleep and eat. I did buy a TV to keep myself entertained on my days off because New York was on Stay-at-home initiative due to COVID and the businesses, shows and tours in the City were entirely closed. The building is very safe. Not the greatest sound proofing but I had no issues with it overall it was quiet."

"13126","40749405","621250011",2020-03-29,1131039,"Catherine","For a NYC Airbnb, this place is good in some ways and not so good in others. Good water pressure, cozy bed linens, good location for commuting to Times Square, and a good neighborhood full of Audubon Murals made this a good place for us. The one radiator that made one bedroom into a sauna for two days and continued to be very hot when the outside temperature was nearly 70F (because the thermostat is in the basement), the windows without screens that also don't stay open without something to hold them open, the hot water heater not working for two days, the mouse droppings (but no mice, thankfully), the bugs that live behind the fridge and creep out to the sink, the general wear and tear that the place and furniture have suffered over the years (scratches, stains, gouges) all make it less than ideal. And there is the front door to the building which usually doesn't latch unless you push or pull it to lock, and the other building residents don't make that effort. The heat, hot water, and front door were the things I asked Danny (Billie's business partner according to Danny and Cousin Zac) to fix. The heat and hot water were fixed after two days. If I were new to NYC, I would be rather uncomfortable with that front door to the building; how do you know who has entered the building and is waiting for you in the hallway? Perhaps this is the reason why they don't give you the correct address until the day you are checking in.
I read another review that mentioned the pipe noise. Yes, the radiators do have air in them and make banging noises as they heat. The apartment is relatively quiet for being on Broadway, with the usual loud voices and sirens. The workers in the laundromat will turn down their party music if you ask nicely, but you can always hear what they are watching on TV.
Internet speed was good, but I don't know if I would have received the log-on information if I had not asked Zac. I really love when hosts have a booklet of information for guests; this place does not have a booklet or welcome sheet. The large TV wasn't working while we were there, but I told Danny that wasn't a problem for us. I gave him a list of things that he should be aware of and possibly fix for other guests."

Super convenient access to the metro and lot’s of cool shops/bars to check out locally in LES. Bella was very quick to respond and answered any questions we had. The apartment is small but perfect for 2 people and extremely clean and tidy. Be careful of the bed - it’s so comfortable you might sleep in and miss half the day! There’s also a blue bottle coffee shop right around the corner to get the day going (jet lag is real). Overall, great place to stay and would definitely book with Bella again!"

Had some issues upon arrival as check in instructions are not very clear. The lockbox to obtain the key was in an obscure location that was not communicated to us before arrival. Be prepared to walk up 5 flights of stairs with your luggage! Pack light or you’re in for quite a workout! Very comfortable bed, but made a run to Target to get new sheets and pillowcases as the sheets didn’t appear very clean. The television in the living room did not work/connect to the Apple TV box. Messaged the host about this issue and didn’t receive a response. I also messaged the host about a late checkout of an hour later and also didn’t receive a response. All in all, decent accommodations at an awesome price. Would recommend as long as the host worked out a few of the aforementioned kinks."

The pictures do not reflect the state of the rooms. The rooms are definitely more on the worn outside with marks on walls, paint chipping.  Communication with the host wasn’t with ease. Multiple times I had to reach out and follow up on certain issues with the AirBnB. The thermostat in the smaller room was not working and no one came to fix It. Listed amenities include toilet paper but when asked to stock up on toilet paper, the host stated that they only supply it during check-in which was a minor inconvenience.

Great restaurants are within a 10 minute walk (try Seppe - you won't regret it), the staten island ferry is a 10 min drive/25 min walk, and the neighborhood felt safe for our week there.  Other great additions: a driveway for our car, a smartTV for some great netflix nights, fully stocked with household essentials (plenty of toilet paper during this Coronavirus crisis lol), and featured a laundry space.  Also, Chimene is very easy to reach with any questions to help make our stay worry free.

The only slight disappointment was I did have to cancel the last night due to the virus (and because of the coronavirus guidelines, that was possible according to airbnb) and Dawn and David weren't accommodating until I myself reached out to airbnb and they were forced to give me a refund for the last night. 

Generally I know airbnb does not offer refunds for this sort of thing, and I've never asked for one before in all my years of staying in airbnbs, but I figured Dawn and David would have been a little more understanding since theoretically I could have cancelled the entire booking last minute due to the virus and they would have lost the entire booking. I know these are wild times right now, so I don't hold it against them, but I wanted to give my full feedback."

"13199","40806223","622726754",2020-04-19,119527502,"Paul","The host and his partner smoke heavily in their downstairs rooms frequently. This smoke lofts up into the guest area, sometimes strongly. My clothes smelled of smoke days after leaving. Feel like this is only a fair warning which needs to be communicated clearly so other guests no what they’re getting into. Beyond this, my biggest problem with Kenny was he literally came into my room once and said I had to keep it more clean (my own room i was paying for!) Or else he would consider cancelling on me. (Note: i just had clothes lying everywhere, not foodstuff or anything gross) I find this outrageous and unacceptable. Kenny is a nice person who goes above and beyond sometimes, in little ways, but then at other times he is ridiculously unyielding on bigger issues. Besides the already mentioned examples, for long term stays, he charges an amount far too high for you to have guests overnight (~$70?)."

Shannon keeps a very tidy, cozy, and comfortable apartment in East midtown Manhattan, which was exactly what I needed during my stay. It was quite hot in NYC during this trip, and getting around was complicated by the pandemic situation, so it was nice to have a cute studio apartment with big windows that was situated near major bridges and subway lines as well. The citybike station right up the block came in really handy too. I should also note that Shannon was super thoughtful and responded very quickly to inquiries. All in all a lovely stay during otherwise uncertain times. Would stay again."

Beyond a great space for my long term stay, they were extremely helpful with everything I needed and went above and beyond to help me every time I had a question or needed something. 

Here was my experience with the space: the room and bed were super comfortable, the common area was spacious, and the bathroom was new and clean (plus had a waterfall shower which made waking up every morning a little better). The neighborhood, particularly Franklin Ave, also had a ton of great bars and restaurants. 

I honestly have nothing negative to say. Highly recommend, great experience all around."

Almost immediate responses for questions we had. What was even more impressive was the thoughtfulness of household necessities (paper towels-tp-trash bags-laundry detergent etc...) and cleaning supplies that were provided. Sometimes when you rent a place for some reason the cleaning supplies are locked up so you have to buy those things. We were here for 6 weeks and little things like disposable ear plugs, a Brita water filter and a bedroom fan (in addition to the air conditioners for each room) didn’t go unnoticed. Lots of little things we loved. Thanks for the great stay!"

The apartment is full of light and well decorated. We were 3 people so I used the couch which I have to say was not very comfy ( very hard mattress and a hollow in the middle), although we did have a good time. Thanks again."

I have chronic allergies so I could not leave the space like that. When we went for the broom and the shovel to clean there seemed to be dust in the shovel still from weeks or days I don’t know. The bathroom was dirty. The water in the shower did not drain properly, so whenever we showered it was as though we were bathing in a pool. The toilet kept clogging and we had to unclog it at least 3 times. The bathroom was so nasty from the floor outside to the walls inside the shower. There was hair that had mold on the floor or whatever that was. We informed the host and sent pictures and he said he would personally come clean the house. However it was not in a better state. The first day we got there we had to clean the toilet because we were not comfortable to use it. I would have rather shower at the gym which I took a membership out for the week than shower at the house. The couch in the common area was stained and dirty the sponge to wash dishes is old. I did not even cook for my entire stay. The vent in the bathroom was very dirty also and the light in the room was also filled with dust.   
The other guests were also very inconsiderate with the quiet hours time. They would be up late laughing and talking very loudly in the common area late at night and early hours of the morning and as a college Student this was especially distracting since I had work to be done. 
The sheets need to be thrown away. It made me skin itch and crawl. 
This stay was not good at all. I was very uncomfortable and worried about my health while staying at this place. 
If pictures are needed I can provide them with the dates of my arrival etc."

The space was really nice overall! 

Bedroom was clean and simple with personal AC/heater, huge semi-private patio overlooking a space free from any vehicles or through-traffic, nice kitchen and coffee table to work from. 

The only problem for me was that I couldn't sit upright in bed with my back against the wall. The bed frame was too light so the bed would slowly move away from the wall as I sat."

It has good security (every door has a code) and the front door code is changed regularly. 
The room itself was very clean, and had everything I could need - fully stocked en suite, TV, AC/Heating. If you are in a room facing the street, it can be quite noisy at weekends, but not too loud that it will keep you up!
The kitchen is very modern, and equipped well. The location is great - less than 10 mins walk to the nearest subway which gets you into Manhattan in around 5 minutes. 
i would recommend Gillian's place for both long and short term stays"

"13307","40916956","620060675",2020-03-20,325970293,"Jullian","The short version: DO NOT stay here for more than a few days, and stay only for sleeping and showering.  There are a lot of co host and its very confusing who to talk to, in order to get things addressed.  
Long version: 
Guest staying for a week or maybe two, you can make it here, but if you are staying longer this is not the place for you.  If you are using this place to simply sleep then it is for you, if you need it to accommodate other needs then this place is not for you.  It is cheap and the location has access to subways and a small number of shops but i would advise looking elsewhere.  I am a student and i needed wifi a little above the average person, and there were days where the wifi was simply not working for hours, day or night.  I tried to speak to the host about it, but the person who i spoke to and the person who lived there were two different people and im not sure how good the communication was between them.  The pictures are about the same as it is, but the space was not clean.  PLEASE BEWARE the second door that you enter for other guests does not lock and i had to call Airbnb support to get the host to at least close it. If someone can enter the buildings first door, they have access to essentially all other rooms including the bathroom and kitchen and the doors into your rooms are not solid they are wood and breakable.  Lastly again you will run into wifi problems. I was suppose to stay here with my partner for a month and left after about 2 weeks.  But i will say again, we needed wifi for work, albeit not 5 star wifi just enough to get things done, and even that was a problem.  I would say that if anyone gave a 5 star its because they were upstairs or were only here for a few days. AVOID LONG TERM STAY HERE."

I checked out of Jason's after a weeklong stay and when I arrived at JFK and found that my flight was canceled, I reached out to him to see if he could once again accommodate me. The room that I previously stayed in had already been taken, and Jason kindly offered me a room that he does not normally rent out. As with my first visit, the room was spotless, comfortable, and quiet. I cannot find words for how kind of a person that Jason is and how clean, comfortable, and convenient that his home is.

Jason cooked several meals for me, they were delicious, kind, gestures that went a long way. The bedroom was excellent-spacious and comfortable and bright. The room is on the entrance floor of a duplex. It feels as if one has their own place, as Jason lives on the other floor. The foyer, bathroom, and kitchen were kept exquisitely clean and tidy. I very much appreciated that. There was a container of Lysol wipes. Do those even exist anymore?! They do. I was able to enjoy my beautiful room just 1/2 block from Central Park and conveniently and safely access it whenever I wanted. There are numerous busses and trains within two blocks that lead to most places in the city. This stay was so so much what I needed. It’s always good to stay in a space with good people.

There was an ant problem in the room the second night but Jason was considerate enough to have the room cleaned again. On top of that, he even bought me groceries to make up for it. The only critique I have about the room was how close it was to the street noise and the amount of creaking I heard from the people upstairs. Other than that, I thought about extending my stay once it was getting closer to checkout but I thought it was a red flag when he first suggested if I could pay in cash."

Couldn't sleep for too long. At night, if anyone was entering or exiting their unit, the doors would slam so hard; I would be ripped out of my sleep. It was so loud everytime the door slammed outside my room. My door would shake so much, I thought someone was trying to break in.

Just a gross area. I was harassed by many people asking me for money everywhere I turned. Didn't feel safe.  
A family practically had their whole home propped in front of the building.  Was awakened by people screaming and fighting in front of the building in the middle of the night."

It was bigger than expected and felt so “homey”to me and my family.

Once I got to the place you put a code at the front door and then take an elevator to the 11th floor to the penthouse. (With this I felt unsafe because it seems like anyone could just press 11 and end up right in your Airbnb). Anyways , I get in the Airbnb and there were things out of place , food in the fridge, huge desk and desktop in the middle of the living room. The place looks like the pictures but it was just a mess . So now as I’m looking at the home two men enter the penthouse from the elevator. They were confused as to why we were in their apartment and I was just as confused. I spoke to Joanna’s co host Lewis about this and he told me that supposedly they were leasing and lease was suppose to be up the day prior to me  getting there. He asked me to wait  because he would get them out . At this point I was already turned off and didn’t even feel like I was safe to even stay there anymore so I ended up booking  somewhere else luckily there was someone available to book me so last minute. Honestly Joanna and Lewis seemed like nice people but this was just a big mess and very unprofessional."

El alojamiento me pareció bonito y organizado, 4 habitaciones y 2 baños, no tuvimos ningún inconvenientes a la hora de cocinar algo o de usar el baño a pesar de que habían huéspedes en todas las habitaciones. 
Muy buena experiencia pero el Aire Acondicionado nunca pude usarlo porque según el Host debe estar en el mismo canal del huésped vecino, algo que realmente nunca entendí ni pude utilizar nunca durante la estadía teniendo que abrir las ventanas un poco, me comuniqué con el Host y dijo q enviaría a alguien a verificar pero nunca fue nadie a verificar.

They were very considerate hosts and a super friendly vibe was happening throughout my stay. Access to multiple subway lines and an easy 15 min walk to Whole Foods/retail shopping at 125th. They are under-the-radar superhosts, and take another look at that cozy Moroccan vibe/plantlife in the photos (!)— a truly nice place to find yourself for a week or more. Thanks guys!"

It was very clean and comfortable with 2 beds and a large sofa bed for my family. Such a nice building with clean elevators and security. Cooking in the kitchen was enjoyable there was everything needed and dishwasher was working quickly. I ordered take out food from restaurants by postmates and grocery shopping was easy Fulton 55 market is close to the apartment. I also ordered from Instacart. There was 2 large screen fancy televisions with Netflix my kids loved it. Also there was play station for them and many games! I will definetelly stay here again. I guess right now there is a discount due to the situation in New York. But its amazing! Dogukan is a great host!"

Mary the co host operates like a Nazi. She micromanages manipulates and intimidates guests to control them. While I was using the kitchen she took a picture and sent it to the host. Lana informed her that she wasn’t interested in receiving information related to minor issues. She remains on the couch all day and all night in order to monitor & micromanage the guests. In order to aggravate the guests,she would unplug the microwave and internet router and pretend it was other guest doing this, when it fact it was her.  Mary is an instigator who thrives on arguments. She once started an argument with me because I didn’t recycle on “her command”. She complains about everything.  Lana’s listing is the ideal listing however dealing with the co host Mary is not worth it."

Air conditioning would have been nice, but I’m guessing that’s coming as there was a unit on the floor in my room. 

I was grateful for the responsive hospitality; I felt like my needs were catered to, but never felt my host overbearing, for which I’m glad. 

When I asked about the property’s Covid-19 plan I was told they’ve compensated for the shortage of disinfectants by using  some 90% proof alcohol to sanitize all the ‘common touch’ areas twice a day. Turns out it’s at least 4x more expensive than 70% Isopropyl which apparently can’t be found. I found that a really nice touch, and was grateful for the additional effort. 

All in all an enjoyable stay, and somewhere I’d be happy to revisit next time I’m in town. 

Happy travels!"

The space is ample for two, and was also comfortable when we had two other people over to join us for dinner one of the night's during our stay.  I wish I could speak to the nearby amenities, but with the Corona virus pandemic in full tilt, we did not frequent any spots.  We were here for a moving trip, so did not have any leisure time to enjoy.  In spite of the challenges outside of Camille's four walls, inside them, we felt we had found the perfect refuge.

He communicates excellently and goes out of his way to accommodate whatever needs you may have. Despite other guest being untidy, he comes in every night to make sure the common areas are sanitized and in order. Any issues that may arise, he is quick to offer a solution and just an all around genuinely great person. The space is nicely decorated and designed. The full kitchen has everything you need to do quick meal preps or a 5 course meal. The bedrooms and bathroom are really spacious and well kept. The neighborhood is probably quieter then it would normally be thanks to the Covid-19 situation in NYC but it's still a pretty laid back block. Supermarkets and trains are about 7 to 10 mins away, which is pretty convenient. If you're in Brooklyn for whatever reason, whether it be now or later, seriously check out this place. You won't regret staying here and certainly being hosted by Yinka."

Bait and switch!!!  He then had a friend handling this apartment instead of him for the duration of my stay.  I contacted the host and his friend for a shower rod & curtain since there was none in the bathroom, and received no response for hours.  When the friend did respond, his messages were very short and unfriendly, and he was only concerned about collecting the extra money as mentioned above.  The host’s friend was very rude, far from gracious, and banged on the door when he arrived hours later with the shower curtain.  This made me feel very unsafe and like I had no choice but to give him the cash on the spot for fear of my safety.  He also requested that I take videos of the apartment because it was on the market, and prospective renters came to my door trying to view this apartment during my stay.  Completely unacceptable!!  If this apartment was managed properly, it would be great in all other aspects.  However, the host seems to delegate management to a third party and doesn’t care to be involved at all, since any time I contacted him his only response was to “work it out with his friend.”"

Cons- no communication to enquiries prior to arrival
- wrong address given to check in resulting in Uber driver having to wait 10 minutes until we got hold of host g/f
- no curtain to any bedrooms even after advising host girlfriend, ie no privacy from laneway behind building or buildings next to it
- blocked toilet on 2nd day - advised to buy plunger and drain liquid to fix


Over all it’s a g8 apartment once the issues are fixed. 

It is small but if you are out and about most of the day it’s no problem."

Always reaching out to check on me. I came in the middle of epidemic and she made me felt safe. She went above and beyond and got me grocery when things get crazy out there.  Her place is very comfortable and quiet. Her apartment is facing the back of the other's backyard, so it is surprisingly quiet.  I love to cook and happy that her cookware sets worked out great. The apartment was perfect for me. If I do return to NYC, I would love to stay here again. The only thing I wish was different was the bed, it is on the softer side. But I got used to it after a week.

As a long term rental, I would not recommend it. There is no microwave or toaster (which is partially my fault for not asking but I assumed that was standard in kitchens) also the room is in the basement and while there is WiFi. There is no cell service. Which means you can only make calls and messages on WiFi and i think this should be told to guests beforehand. Since there are several people staying in the apt (including someone on the couch in the living room on several nights) there is not much room to put your belongings anywhere such as in the fridge or bathroom. And the bathrooms could be a bit cleaner with 5 people using them."

"13614","41258335","620436636",2020-03-22,55802752,"Romain","Mae's flat was just perfect for us. We travelled to New York from London with our 2.5 yo son and our nanny and it almost felt like coming home. The flat itself is very large, with big bedrooms, a large living room/dining/kitchen area and a huge guest bedroom/play area in the lower ground floor. There is a big outside space with a trampoline which was great for our kid (although it was still winter weather). The flat is well equipped with everything you need and Mae allowed us to use the scooter and pushchair for our son. 

The checkin is easy with a lockbox outside the flat. The area (Greenpoint) is very nice, very diverse, with lots of little shops and cafes around - there is a large supermarket with lots of organic food around the corner (not cheap though...) and the ferry to Manhattan is about 7-9 min away, as are the two subway stations. There is a small playground at the end of the street for kids to play. 

We had to shorten our 3-week trip in NYC and fly back home earlier than scheduled due to the coronavirus lock down but Mae was very understanding and made our change of dates very easy. 

I would recommend Mae's place to anyone who is looking for a genuine Airbnb experience in New York/Brooklyn. 

We couldn't have found better for our family and within our budget.

Location is the best you can get for living downtown NYC. But most of all, I really appreciated the hosts' attention and thoughtfulness... They inquired about my comfort and made sure I had everything I needed throughout.  I had to shorten my stay as a result of the travel restrictions due to the Covid19 outbreak and they were extremely helpful.  They reimbursed me for the rest of the stay and offered to host me if I was stranded and could not fly back home... Everything you would expect and more from great hosts and wonderful people.  Would highly recommend them/the apt for a stint in NYC.  Really worth it!"

They have been so thoughtful throughout my one month stay, this place is probably one of the most well equipt places I've stayed in, it feels more like a home than a rental. The view from the balcony is amazing, the place has a great vibe and is perfect for both a workplace environment and chill. Unfortunately I wasn't able to enjoy what Chelsea had to offer during the pandemic but I can say that there are tonnes of shops, bars, restaurants all around! Thanks again to the fantastic hosts"

It's not a spacious place, but that's par the course for NYC and it more than makes it up in location. Being a couple blocks away from the first M station in Brooklyn, I can't think of a place with easier access to Manhattan that is not already in Manhattan. I'd possibly hesitate to recommend it to a very light sleeper (the room gets a lot of light in the morning and it's not room exactly quiet at night), but it was perfect for me, and I believe for most guests.

Caecilia and Dan were both thoughtful, considerate, and thoroughly helpful hosts. They accommodated my late night check-in, gave me helpful suggestions about nearby places and life in NYC (I used this apt as a springboard to move to the city). I strongly recommend them and their place for anyone visiting the city!"

The location is outstanding, with easy access to food, parking, transportation and bars.

Plenty of room for my clothes and equipment (In area on a work assignment)

The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen and appliances were fantastic!
Except for having pizza my first night, I prepared all my meals on site.
This was a huge advantage over staying in a hotel.  

The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots/pans, dishes, spices, tea.......
Dave even left me eggs for my breakfast.

I would not hesitate to return to this location or to recommend it to my family and friends."

The flat had everything you need for a longer stay. 
The location was truly great, so were the restaurants and bars tips Ben and Alexis provided us with. There is a plenty of cafes and restaurants just around the corner and the subway station (L-line) is just 4-minutes footwork away, straight to Manhattan. A big grocery store is one block away. Everytime we needed some additional information, we reached out to Ben and he got back to us super quickly. 
One of the reasons we enjoyed our stay in NYC so much was because we lived in this great apartment that immediately felt like home. 
Thank you for having us!"

It was our first time in the USA, and I happy that our hosts were Eric and Rachel. They are so welcoming and caring - if I had a question, it was never left unanswered. At the same time, they never bothered me, you can live your introvert life and barely see someone else. 
The bathroom is shared, it’s brand new and clean. Clean towels were provided every week. Place is close to N, R train, some bus routes. The kitchen is a big plus. it’s your private kitchen, you can cook by yourself and save money.

The neighborhood is lively, but with the windows closed, it’s extremely quiet. 

Occasionally you will hear the walking of upstairs neighbors or then running down the hallway steps and out the front door, but that is normal in New York City and it doesn’t happen so often that it becomes disturbing. And of course, these tenants may change in the future. 

The bedroom doesn’t have a door, but it’s off to the side of the back room. The bed is extremely cozy with the BEST.  BLANKET. EVER. I slept very well. 

The living room is very spacious and artsy and the ceilings are some of the highest you’ll find in New York City. The bathroom is narrowly constructed and may be uncomfortable for a larger-sized person. All in all, it was a lovely and easy stay and check-in was very simple."

The bed was comfortable but the pillow/pillow case was washed. It had a moldy smell to it and I'm hoping it wasnt the smell of someone's sweat. That is extremely reckless to not have the sheets washed considering there is a pandemic right now especially in NYC. Finally the I was sharing the room with either a couple or 2 random man and woman who decided the best time to have sex was 3am underneath my bunk bed. How could the host allow couples to share a room with a stranger is beyond me. If the price was $10 less I wouldve have said anything."

She was a wonderful host, willing to help with anything and an overall really nice person. Her apartment is adorable, and so are her two cats. The bedroom I was in was super spacious, luminous and cozy, couldn't have loved it more. I stayed for a month and a half and I really recommend her place for long stays, since Anna gives you access to her kitchen and you have a washing machine and tumble dryer inside the building (shared with the neighbors) that you can use for free. The location is also fantastic, I adored the area. All in all, a great experience, and at a fantastic price for what you get. Thank you Anna! :)"

O bairro é bastante seguro e cheio de opções de alimentação, farmácia e supermercado. Anfitrião responde com muita velocidade. O quarto é espaçoso e exatamente como na foto, tudo muito novo, com uma grande TV e cama confortável. Se você optar pelo quarto 8, pode ter problemas com a internet (no meu caso, praticamente não funcionou durante toda estadia). A limpeza do banheiro poderia receber mais atenção, mas não chega a ser sujo - acredito que seja em virtude das obras que estão acontecendo no local (gerou um pouco de transtorno para mim, mas mostra que o anfitrião está melhorando o local para que os próximos tenham uma experiência excelente). No geral foi uma boa experiência, recomendo."

We had some troubles with the arrival cause we got a wrong message and the host sent us to the wrong house and wrong room. The room was simple but exactly like we expected regarding the price we paid. The biggest problem was the bathroom which was the whole time during our stay dirty, covered with hair everywhere (which couldn't be ours cause it was black and all of us have bright hair). The location was good, close to metro station, with many Deli groceries around opened to late hours. I advise to not come home very late, cause we didn't always feel safe. Also I couldn't understand why people were doing such a mess inside the house after midnight. But in general it was fine. Good for young people travelling lowcost who won't get scared off easily."

Linda atendió todas nuestras solicitudes con rapidez y eficacia, nos sentimos muy a gusto en su alojamiento. 
Se trata de un pequeño piso compartido con otras dos habitaciones de huéspedes, cocina y 1 baño. Dispones de nevera, cafetera, hervidor de agua....
La cama es cómoda y la habitación en la que estuvimos acogedora.
La cocina tb es acogedora.
Además, tuvimos que cancelar las 4 últimas noches ya que tuvimos que volver antes a España por el tema del coronavirus, y Linda nos reembolsó el importe que le solicitamos.
Muchas gracias Linda! Si volvemos a NY sin dudarlo, nos quedaremos en tu alojamiento."

We stay for 2 days (during this pandemic) because my boyfriend and I needed a little get away. When we got there we had trouble getting in but the host was fast with giving us the steps that we needed , the broker let us in he had 3 other men with us i guess showing them the apartments in the building. Just when we were getting settled in he came knocking on the door asking to come in and gave a tour to the same 3 guys we saw previously. At first he assumed we were the cleaners. He came back a second time saying he needed to record the place while we were there , we let him . The second night he came back a third time with two new people wanting to tour the apartment. I was just getting out the shower and my boyfriend told him to come back later. He came back with two individuals we did not know. At this point i was extremely uncomfortable with him interrupting and coming in and out it was very weird. Other then that weird encounter the place, location , back yard and other houses were very pleasant."

House was deff smaller in person than it seemed in pictures. Some things are missing in house dish washing sponges then oven wasn’t working. We did message the host trying to ask how to fix or work it but there was no response. Bathroom door knob was loose every time we opened and closed the door we had to be careful for it not to fall off. When I was unpacking my bags I came to sit on the side of the bed and the wood panels fell underneath, after that we didn’t wanna sleep in that bed incase anything else happens we had to sleep in the other bedroom. When we went to the other bedroom we tried to put on the heat in there but it wasn’t working. When we did voice this to the host she didn’t even respond to our concerns about the bed breaking or the heat.  Communication wasn’t great but was still able to have fun other than that"

The building is new and modern so the kitchen and bathroom are very nice and clean and tidy, too. Don’t be scared of the Roomba vacuum if it starts suddenly! The French bulldog is both handsome and charming and it was nice bonus to meet him.

The area is quiet and nice, you have Central Park and the metro station 1 Avenue away and it's perfect to go anywhere in the city. I would definitely stay here again if I had the chance.

But the best thing about the apartment were Jonathan and Yvette. We were there when the coronavirus started in our country and we so how the situation became cray at home. The last days our country started to close borders and we didn't know if we could make it home. Jonathan and Yvette were always there to help us and always offered us help and extra time to stay if we needed to. This was just one of many examples of the great hospitality they gave us. Probably the best hosts I've found in Airbnb in many years."

First off he says if I rent for a month he would refund me the money I spent over $1,900, I spent about $2,600 and as soon as it was time to pay me he saying I'm smoking in his property (which he is there everyday so that is impossible to do) I smoke in my car which I can do all day if I like its not disturbing you or your neighbors and its it decriminalization so he should really grow up. I kept the property clean because I also own a house and know how that is to upkeep. In a nut, shell place is cool for a day or 2 but no long term. I would believe nothing that man says. The female managing the property seems a lot more straight forward then the maintenance guy acting like the owner. #BookWithCaution"

The beds were comfortable and the shower pressure was good (I know some people who really appreciate good shower pressure!). The couch was not very comfortable, but it was functional.

"14042","41706717","621931565",2020-04-06,342493779,"Molly","This is a long review, but please read everything. Overall, I would NOT recommend staying at this airbnb. The apartment was infested with mice, but what stood out to me from this experience was not the infestation but rather the rudeness of the host. When I was initially looking at properties, thought it was a very beautiful apartment. I reached out to the host & explained that I needed to finalize my plans but that I was almost definitely going to book the apartment. I asked if it could be reserved, explaining that I would book it ASAP-- in a few hours. The host said that was no problem and said that it could be reserved for me. When I went to book a few hours later, it turns out that the apartment had *not* been reserved for me. By total coincidence, I actually booked it at the exact same moment as another guest, causing the system to glitch so that I & the other guest received overlapping confirmations. The host decided to give the property to the other guest even though the other guest was only requesting 2 nights (I booked it for 10) and even though we had an agreement that the host would reserve the property for me. This was the first sign that this host wasn't very honest. 
Anyway, the host offered me a different property and said that once the other guest moved out, he would move me to my preferred airbnb AT HIS EXPENSE. Offering to pay for my transport to the second airbnb was the least he could do since I had booked that airbnb before it was given away to someone else. So I went to the temporary airbnb, which was a perfectly fine property. Although, when I arrived the television wouldn't work & the host was very annoyed at me for expressing my disappointment in the non-functional television. The host claimed that I must have done something to it because it worked perfectly well before. Eventually, I realized that some cables were unplugged. I was able to get it to work, but he was no help & quite aggressive. 
When the two days were up, I took an uber to the airbnb I wanted. I saved a photo of the receipt so he could reimburse me later as he had promised. When my friend and I arrived, we observed that the garbage was still full of trash and leftover food. We tried to do some laundry & had troubles with the machine. We could not get it to work. When I called the host, he just told me I don't know how to use a washing machine. He was unhelpful and rude. Eventually, we figured out the machine. But it absolutely drenched our clothing and then the dryer was ineffective. So, not good machinery. But I assume the host will just claim I do not know how to use a washer or dryer. He didn't have a lot of patience for assisting with problems with his property. 
The trash & washing/drying machine were annoyances. The bigger problem was that the apartment was infested with mice. My friend was so uncomfortable about the mice that he moved out of the airbnb. Later, as I was checking-out, I mentioned the mice to the host who swore he had no idea. But I highly doubt that this is a new problem, and I'm sure the guest before us noticed the mice. 
Another problem-- upon our arrival we were confronted by a very angry neighbor in the building who lives on the floor below. She demanded to know if we were with airbnb and in the stress of that moment, my friend and I confirmed that we were. She immediately called the landlord, yelling about how it was illegal for us to stay there. 
By the end of our stay, I felt very uncomfortable reaching out to the host for help with anything. He had continuously taken very antagonistic tones with me and often expressed his annoyance with any questions I had. After we left, I sent him the receipt for my uber as well as my (Hidden by Airbnb) information. He had promised to cover the fees of my move from the first airbnb to the second. After ignoring my messages, he finally responded: 

Molly dear.. you leave me a great five stars Review and I’ll take care of your ride.
You put me in serious troubles taking to the neighbor.. I will really appreciated if at least you can leave the review and I will be more then happy to cover your expense 

I was shocked at the blatant dishonesty. I had already explained to him the mice infestation & he still wanted me to write a dishonest review. He insisted I give him a 5 star review or he would withhold the money he promised me. In the end, I decided to give up that money because I did not feel okay with writing a dishonest review. Furthermore, I thought it was disgusting that he tried to guilt me into giving a 5 star review by blaming me for speaking with his neighbor. 

Bottom line: The apartment is pretty, but the washer/dryer don't really work and there is a mouse infestation. None of these things alone are dealbreakers for me. The big problem was the host. I would never do business with this man again. He was rude, condescending, manipulative, etc. He added a lot of stress to my airbnb experience. Also, there is a very very nasty woman who lives on the floor below who will confront you if she sees you (this host is doing airbnb illegally). We practically tip-toed around the apartment for the whole 10 days. We were afraid of listening to music or even speaking loudly past a certain time out of fear that she would have us kicked out. 

There are a lot of beautiful apartments in NYC. This one was nice, but it was *not* worth it"

Great neighborhood, one block to all trains and buses. We took the train to Manhattan got the in 25 minutes. 

The property also has a house manual which helped us control all the amenities. There's lights everywhere that works by remote. We would have never figured out how to work all the amazing  stuff there without the manual. 

JB The Host was there for everything we needed and also gave us an extended 2 hour stay at no cost. Property has everything,  Complementary hookah, cognac dispenser installed on the wall, slippers, toothpaste, toothbrush, hair shampoo and conditioner at no additional cost.

The bedroom is awesome, each day we didn't want to get out of it. This is the most comfortable bed we've have ever slept in. I will definitely be back to this property with a longer stay this time. So sad we have to leave.

Then was nice and this time it’s even nicer. Very consistent with the place being clean and the place smells so so good. I enjoyed this place in and out. Got to relax and actually slept in the back yard. Love the surround sound while watching movies. This place was a real treat. I really felt like I was away on vacation. I Highly recommend this place."

I was asked by Swipe to cancel on my end because his reviews will go down if he cancels. When I canceled I waited a whole 24 hours for him to confirm my cancellation and he declined it. When I asked why he told me that he did not know that I canceled when it states in my email that HE denied my cancellation. I have proof of every single conversation we had, the time, and pictures which was also sent to him. All Swipe could have done was send me my full refund especially because I canceled literally 2 minutes after he told me he can’t accommodate my guest and I. I had to reach out to Air bnb in order for me to receive some sort of reimbursement. Nice property but what Swipe did was totally unacceptable."

My check-in was no hassle, even though I was late checking in.  But I tell you,  I was amazed how clean it was and some type of fragrance there made you feel like you are on some island.  The place is like new.  That studio was put together very nicely and the backyard is connected to the studio. The host explains everything to me about how everything works. Really cool and friendly person.  I love how Alexa controls everything from the lights to the AC, and especially the mood lighting.  You just tell Alexa to change the colors of the led lights, turning things on and off with voice commands. I will book this place again next week.  I highly recommend this place."
"14077","41736590","620788364",2020-03-24,1413546,"Asher","Curtie's apartment is very clean, great comfortable beds and comforters, clean bathroom and towels, nice touches in the back bedrooms. We got a very good price on the apartment because of the city was in lockdown and every one cancelled travel reservations. Because of that, the street in which the apartment is which is EIGHT Avenue  and 29th Street one block below Madison Square Garden, was a lot quieter than it would have been in normal times because there was almost no traffic and all the businesses were closed, including the pub downstairs. This apartment is on a 2nd floor facing the street. The subway passes right under neath the apartment and the whole building trembles every few minutes. However, if one is in the back 2 bedrooms and the door is closed, the noise is substantially lower and one can sleep. There is one bedroom in the front next to the tinny living room, and that one is very noisy. Also notice there is no dinning table. The apartment is definitely a lot smaller than it looks in the wide angle pictures, but if you don't mind the noise, this is very centrally located but is in the middle of the intense craziness of the worse of NY in a regular traffic madness and 3 million people getting in and out of the Penn Station also one block away.  On the positive side, there is a great juice and salad place downstairs, and there are a lot of pubs if you like to drink."

The flat is surrounded by lots of shops so it was easy to get all the supplies I needed, which I loved. The  subway and bus stop is right on their doorstep too so it makes any journey feel less of a hassle straight away. I had a lovely stay. Thank you Carlos and Tiffany for everything!"

The Check-in co-host was curtious and helpful. Listing clearly mentioned air mattress, which was not there and the cohost graciously brought one however it did not have the air pump and hence useless. Apartment was quite unclean with a dinky vacuum. 
We had reserved the apartment from Mar. 13-20, and due to force majeur COVID19 situation left NY on 16th. Air bnb were offering no cancelation etc., however in this special situation it would have been good if they helped the customers better."

Syed (The host ) took my money before explaining the proper circumstances. We i first booked I planned on having an event. But $450 wasn’t in my price, which I kindly explained. BUT THIS WAS NEVER IN THE DESCRIPTION. He THEN explained that he’ll lower the price to $350 AFTER I said that’s Still not in my price range. I said I won’t have the event, because my flight and reservations was already  booked. I’ll stay there for shelter. He then still turned me down, because of the event price. It took two days to actually hear something from AirBnb and didn’t get refunded until days later. My best advice is if you’re going to book this bnb speak with the host first !!!!!"

If you’re looking for a super comfortable, easy, relaxing studio to hang your hat for a month or two (or ten!) this is the apartment for you. Beautifully comfortable bed, cable-equipped television, super speedy WiFi, small yet functional kitchen and an efficient washer and dryer in unit to boot! It’s a very unique space with a private entry (no doorman hassles!) that welcomes you to an outdoor courtyard before going up one short flight of stairs and through your front door. 

The owners of the unit were super attentive regarding any and all requests or challenges. The location is a hop, skip and a jump away from Gramercy and the Flatiron district offering  top rate restaurants, fitness venues (Equinox, Barry’s) and buzzy, hip watering holes. 

If your coming to visit for a holiday or need a place to lay your head whilst in town for work...this is the place for you. Intimate, easy...and good value for money. Enjoy!"

The front desk agent continued to have an attitude and insisted  that the housekeeper said the rooms were fine and ""it's not her fault"". So we had to get a second room and the TV in this room didn't work so I had to go back downstairs again and get a third room. I asked the front desk agent give me a room where everything works and she became argumentative and she told me that there was no problem with the rooms and that it's not her fault and kept insisting that I take my card back and go somewhere else. The area around this hotel is very sketch,  dirty and there's lot of random late night traffic outside the hotel.

She is very attentive and help you with every need as she provides u with all u need to stay on a safe, clean, comfortable and spacious bedroom that is nicely decorated. Her entire place is so clean including her bathroom and kitchen. You have all the technology u need for your down time including fast wifi and tv cable. This is a residential neighborhood so it is convenient if you have a car if not, there is a bus that takes u on a short ride to the 5 and 2 trains stop near Brooklyn College. Either train gets you to the city in about 30 minutes. Again, this is a great place and a great value for the money. Even if you match the cost, her room is way bigger than a comparable room for the same price and it has a lot of windows, sunshine in the morning and super quiet. Last but not least, heating system works perfectly and she gives you clean towels and others cleaning goods to keep things clean and access to the kitchen where u can have a breaksfast or heat your food, etc. Again, great service for the money and safe."

Second, the room (and the whole house) was richly decorated and many useful items were there to us to use, all super clean and tidy. Everything had a super cool and homy vibe and we did enjoy it so much, specially the cat that is such a sweetie. The COVID-19 stroke while we were there and I can assure you there won't be a better host, event in this difficult times. We were sad we had to leave earlier than planned but because of inestability of the airlines we had to leave a bit before. Lee was super understanding and helped a lot with everything. Plus! the house is located in Bushwick, not too close to be stressed but not to far to be lazy, you can walk easily to places from there and I must say that's pretty difficult to find in NYC. Summarizing, our stay in Lee's place was the best airbnb experience we ever had! Thanks so much!"

For two years my partner and I had been saving for a Hawaiian wedding, honeymoon cruise and other celebrations. All of these plans went down the drain with all these closures. So this past weekend, instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we put together an intimate wedding at this beautiful Airbnb. With help from their Chefs and massive projector screens the rest of our quarantined family joined us online. I cried like a baby!! We began the ceremony downstairs and had our romantic honeymoon upstairs :-) It took a global pandemic to make us realize that weddings can still be perfect without breaking the bank."

I was fortunate enough to be shown a night on the town by the host's brother, AJ. He escorted me to a nice hip hop club and later that evening to a well known R&B club called Cafe Wha. I was entertained by a great band and even got a chance to sing at open mic. I also ran into a good friend I grew up with.
The room was well decorated, clean, well put together and peaceful. The host provided much time, care and attention to my needs. I could easily say so many more good things! A five start rating isn't enough!"

This place is always very clean!Sometimes I would be gone several days at a time for work, but whenever I was there, it was pleasant. Nicole and her mother are so hospitable. The location is convenient as well and I felt safe. There’s a grocery store, restaurants and a laundromat across the street. Target, the mall, and other stores are a short walk. Bus/train transportation are also very near. It’s a bustling neighborhood that I was happy to be in for my stay. If you have any concerns, Nicole is always willing and available to assist.

Les indications pour se rendre à l'appartement sont bien expliquées à l'avance, Claudio est très présent par message. La propreté du coin chambre et salle de douche privative nécessiterait un peu plus d'attention...
De plus, le chauffage de la chambre avait un problème lors de notre venue, il fuyait de temps en temps et faisait du bruit par moment ce qui devenait gênant la nuit. La porte coulissante de la salle de douche étant mal accrochée, rend moins intime les passages à la douche et aux toilettes."

But I guess all apartments are like that in NYC. The neighborhood was kind of scary, probably because of the world situation. But the location is excellent, really close to Manhattan’s and Brooklyn’s bridges, walking distance to the financial district. A lot of good grocery shopping options such as trader joe’s and whole foods around. The host keeps the apartment very clean. Thank you for hosting us at the very last moment!"

- Abe is an excellent host with quick responses!
- Very spacious area, with kitchen, dining area and two full bathrooms. 
- Good location and only one block from the subway

CONS:
- Upstairs neighbors were a bit loud in the AM (usually around 8-9am). I realize this is a part of NYC (close living spaces) and there is little Abe can do about this, but it was still inconvenient.
- Maybe it was just unclear to me, but I was under the impression that this was 2 private bedrooms, but it is one private bedroom and the other bedroom is a shared space first thing when you walk in the apartment. Just something to keep in mind, if that is important to you."

You will probably never see this review because Airbnb deletes bad reviews , they want you to buy their product."

"14333","42073623","625604077",2020-05-22,137375009,"Ashley","First things first, I booked with BRENDA. NOT TAYRON. When I got to my listing, the keys to the front door were already gone and I had to ring every bell on the intercom before a girl came to open the door. She reeked of alcohol and looked like she’d shot up drugs all night. 
There was a disgustingly loud party happening in the apartment right next to the one I was supposed to stay in- where the girl came from. 
I go into the apartment, as the party pours into the hallway and men are literally fighting down the stairs. 
I go to my door and I couldn’t get in. Then a man opens the door to the room I ALREADY BOOKED AND PAID FOR. He explains he’d been there all week and was there with his two friends and shut the bedroom door on me. 
I sat in the living room of this Airbnb for over an hour waiting for either the host, Brenda, or Airbnb to respond to me. It was past 1am MY TIME when Airbnb finally responded to me via email telling me to book a hotel and they’ll cover the cost. 
It’s been OVER A WEEK. And I’ve gotten not one call from Airbnb, an apology from a host, or my money back for the AIRBNB AND HOTEL I had to book due to this issue. 

Given the neighborhood this apartment is in, and with the Coronavirus pandemic in full effect- this was a grotesque example of Airbnb’s response time and conflict resolution. I will be calling in the morning for my damn money."

I texted them previously before checking in on how to get in the building no response. I had to ask a neighbor if they know the codes to the door. When I got in the apt I noticed the kitchen was dirty and roaches crawling through the cabinets. The bedroom was worst the bed was broken. It looked like the cleaning lady came in to clean and disregarded the fact that I have to sleep on a broken bed. The bed was lopsided half of it was dropped to the floor how was I supposed to sleep that night. I texted the hosts and no response once again. They are so unprofessional, I just got an email to write a review but I’m pretty sure they saw my complaints when they sent the message. Would not recommend to book this place at all."

A lot of the local tourist spots were closed because of the virus and luckily, we left New York just as all the restaurants were closing so our trip wasn’t interrupted too much. 
This apartment is just what you would expect in New York City! It’s in a PRIME location. 2 blocks from time square and on a quiet residential street. It is across from the subway going downtown and one block going uptown. There was a bus stop across the street too!The apartment was the perfect size and made us feel safe. There is a 24/7 doorman who monitors guests and they were super friendly! The apartment is simple and had all the necessities. There was a coffee pot available, Brita, microwave and soap/dishes. We didn’t have a chance to really utilize the stove and cook, but it is a great addition for those who have the time. The beds were perfect for us also. Two twin sized beds in the living room with a tv and a queen in the bedroom. I can’t express how great Apple and Tasny were and how they made the trip great even with everything going on in the world! This cute little apartment just further confirmed this is where I’m meant to live one day! Can’t wait to be back. Thank you again!"

"14427","42195148","622883654",2020-04-21,71486834,"Kaitlyn","Good: location. The location is great and really close to many hospitals on the east side. I felt safe walking my dog around the area and there was a target and Duane reede within a few minute walk. The brick wall is what really makes it aesthetically pleasing. Decent value for the area and it being a one bedroom. Laundry!

Poor: DIRTY. In the midst of a pandemic, this home was not cleaned. There was food in the microwave, the stove still had grease from cooking. The amenities promised were not there such as plush towels, a fully stocked kitchen, broom or mop. There was one fork and two butter knifes total. There was one towel and one hand towel for the bathroom and kitchen. The description states it can sleep 4, however not with these amenities. I was told by the manager to purchase items from target and I would be reimbursed, which after over a week of reminders I have yet to be fully reimbursed for the items. SAFETY. I do not believe anyone inspected the apartment prior to move in (obviously with the cleaning issues) as the window beside the door would not go down fully to lock and the window in the bedroom leading to the fire escape did not have a lock at all. I informed him of this and the super stopped by. The super then stopped by again unannounced the following day. Upon moving out, there was still no lock on the bedroom window. I asked for the crib in the closet to be removed, to which the manager said that is fine and to place it outside the door. The crib/mattress sat outside in mine and my neighbors doorway and was still there upon moving out. The heat cannot be adjusted within the apartment. I am unsure where the thermostat is located but it is managed for the whole building per the manager. 

Overall, I would not stay here again due to above issues. The apartment has real potential but these other issues make it unwelcoming."

Once inside we were welcomed to a very clean home and much bigger in person by the way. My favorite sections I’ll say was the kitchen and the bedroom. The kitchen had everything and I mean everything I needed to cook with to make nice homey meals, so many pots and pans, cooking utensils, etc. The bedroom was very comfortable with a nice size TV where you can watch Netflix if you’d like and a very comfy bed where you can get some nice rest. It also was a very convenient location, it had several stores around and even a 24 hour convenient store. We truly loved this space. Bryan was also very responsive, kind, detailed, helpful and always had a swift response time to a question we had. Bryan’s place will definitely be bookmarked for a next trip. Thank you Bryan!

It’s located literally right underneath the Williamsburg bridge which is a major plus. There was a nice park I frequented in the night right up the block with stunning views that you just can’t beat.There was no issue whatsoever with parking for me just be mindful of signs ( this is New York ).The apartment itself was also amazing. When you enter the place smells amazing and you quickly feel at home. I loved the unique layout and it was quite cozy and comfortable. Everything from the beds to the cozy living room space with extra throw blankets and pillows just amazing! Thelma and Emerson as hosts provide everything you need.

We are frontline workers in the nearby hospitals and needed a quick place to crash over night between shifts. The space is very nice, the balcony offers this beautiful natural light that illuminates the room. It’s in a great location surrounded by a variety of different restaurants and quick access to public transportation. It’s the perfect spot for one person or a couple to stay in. The hosts responses are quick and they’re ready to answer any questions if needed. 

However for anyone staying at this space I should say, I was put off by the sheets on the bed. I had to sit on it once to realize there was hair on it from another person. There was open packages of food left in the refrigerator but plenty of space to store your own goods.  Lastly the spread of cleaning materials and used rags under the sink did not have a great look. 

All in all the place was satisfying. It provides the basic needs you may require for a short stay."

"14472","42241896","622320453",2020-04-12,24463707,"Rebecca","I would strongly recommend AGAINST renting this property or any others through Clay. 

Communication with Clay was extremely disappointing. From day 1, the Wifi and bathroom plumbing were issues but Clay and his associate Rachel were either very slow to respond or didn't respond at all. Not once were they able to coherently address any of the issues to the point where I had to contact Airbnb Customer Support. 

Airbnb was not able to get in touch with Clay either and advised that because the issues were so bad, I end my reservation early and find other accommodations, which I did. Very disappointing as I had informed Clay that I would be traveling with my father who has limited mobility issues, and triple confirmed that the apartment specs were appropriate for his needs. 

Furthermore, while it looked like great care and detail went into furnishing the place, there was an odor in one of the bedrooms that smelled like something was rotting or very stale. Had to keep a window propped open to be able to sleep at night. 

The bathroom plumbing issues in the main bathroom were horrendous. The sink was clogged and not functional due to how bad it was clogging and the shower stall would overflow with water any time we tried to use it, so water would leak all over the bathroom floor - creating both a mess and a slipping hazard. The bath towels also seemed to be new (tags/stickers still on), but never washed so there was  weird odor to them. 

The kitchen, upon first impression seemed clean, but the I had to really scrub all of the pots and pans on closer inspection. It looked like they had never been cleaned on the bottom or handles and were covered in grease/grime. Several of the drinking glasses also had paint stains on them. There were also NO cooking utensils other than a wooden spatula. Luckily, I have family nearby and they were able to bring us additional items to cook with (including a wine corkscrew, can opener, strainer, scissors, cutting board, roasting pan..)."

I’m here over the weekend for my friend’s birthday party, I didn’t expecting much but the interior design and some small decorations really adds an extra point to my overall experience. Jason was easy to communicate and response my questions quickly! Would definitely stay here again, highly recommend!"

This place is filthy gross. I was here for almost two months and ended up having to clean it myself. 

The walls were blackened with grime. The scum on the shower tiles was so thick you could scratch a line in it with your fingernail. There’s mold in there too and the shower curtain is slimy. Don’t get me started on the rest of the place.

He books out two rooms and I legit witnessed that he never cleaned the blanket on the bed between guests. Plus, he didn’t initially disclose the presence of a surveillance device and then declined to say where it was when asked. 

Yes, all this was politely brought up in the moment. His words when he saw his paying guest cleaning the hallway walls that were covered in ... something... “It’s not that dirty.” He fully recognises that it’s nasty, he just doesn’t care. 

He can live however he likes, but he has no right to expect paying guests to live in his filth with him. 

And that’s just the cleanliness. There’s more wrong with the place and the guy. I mean, look, you just need a place to crash after a wild night out, do you. But maybe bring a sleeping bag and shower shoes.  Btw, the bed in the smaller room is the bottom part of a children’s bunk bed. I’m 5’6” and my feet hung off the end. ✌"

We stayed in his place for a month and always felt welcomed thanks to his hospitality. It seems to me that his place is as same as(or better than) pictures and descriptions in Airbnb. I highly recommend his place for a couple or a small size family for the following reasons. 

First of all, his place is a very clean and spacious studio which is fully equipped (even with free Netflix&Disney&Hulu) with an affordable price. We couldn’t have lots of fun in New York city due to COVID-19 but we really enjoyed staying in his place thanks to Netflix and Disney with a huge and cozy sofa :-)

Secondly, it’s located near a subway (3-5 mins to F&G train by walk) which takes 15 mins to Soho, and bus (2 mins by walk) which take 10 mins to IKEA. 

Third, the neighborhood is so peaceful and surrounded with beautiful brownstones and there are lots of trendy boutique shops and restaurants nearby. Also, there is even a Trader Joe’s which is my favorite grocery store in NYC 15 mins by walk. 

Lastly, Mathieu is the best host I’ve ever met!!! We were looking for a place which we could check in with a day notice. Luckily, he made us feel welcomed even at the late hour. He gave us lots of useful information around the neighborhood and also a first aid kit just in case. Also, he provided us with toilet papers while NYC was having a toilet papers crisis due to COVID-19. He even gave us clean sheets and towels every week so we didn’t need to wash the sheets and towels by ourselves for a month. And he always responded to our messages and requests like changing light bulbs promptly. So we felt very comfortable in his place. 

When I visit NYC in the future, I will definitely stay in his place again!!!"

"14561","42337079","621595049",2020-04-02,125852167,"Dzmitry","My friend and I were straying in Renee’s place about one month in March. Renee always responded quickly to our questions and did everything to make sure that our stay is comfortable. We had a late flight, so there was no way to come to Manhattan before 10pm. From experience I know that some hosts don’t allow a late check-in (after 8pm), but Renee kindly met us after 10pm and made a detailed excursion around our apartment. She lives in the same building.
The apartment spans the whole 4th floor and a part of the 3rd floor. There are 2nd bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and living room on the 4th floor. Also there is a staircase to the roof (an important thing there are no neighbors above the apartment). The master bedroom is on the 3rd floor.
Kitchen has a big refrigerator, gas oven, micro oven and everything necessary for cooking. Coffee machine, toaster, blender, waffle maker are even more than what you’re usually expecting. Everything is almost new in working condition, made by solid, reputable brands. We didn’t check the coffee machine though, because we are trying to stay away from caffeine.
Every corner in the apartment has a touch of thoughtful design. But spacious sunny living room is the best part of it. A white big corner couch is the best place to spend hours watching Netflix on laptop (I want it in my place too). A table near a fireplace is big enough to be a working place for two people with laptops. To summarize people who designed the apartment definitely prioritized comfort over money saving. 
The apartment is quiet. I mean it’s quiet by absolute standard, but not only by Manhattan standard. Both bedrooms are on backyard side. As I said there is no floor above the apartment. Neighbors below were very quiet. A street, which the living room faces, is quiet with low traffic even during the day. Jet lag was mild for me this time, because I slept like a child.
The apartment is located in a quiet nice neighborhood. It’s close to everything: 8min walk to Central Park, 5min to 116st red line subway station, 15min to 116st green line station, 25min subway ride to Times Square. 9min away is Whole Foods. A bit cheaper Best Market, which has a lot of fresh Mexican vegetables, is 6 min away. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to closely explore nearby cafes and restaurants, because of COVID-19 lockdown.
A spiral staircase, which connects the master bedroom to the 4th floor, is a little bit steeply. Elderly people as well as heavily drank people (not our case:) may have trouble using it. The 2nd bedroom is the only way from the master bedroom to bathroom and kitchen. That’s not a problem if you travel along with a close friend or a family member.

Did I forget to mention spacious closets, vacuum cleaner, sky windows and a few other nice things? In short, we would like to stay at Renee’s place again and will advise it to our friends."

The place was beautiful and I was surprised how big the place actually was compared to the pictures posted. Everything I needed was accessible and fairly easy to find. Great neighborhood and great location everything you need is walking distance to the house, from super markets to pharmacy’s. If you get there a little sooner than check in you shouldn’t have a problem finding a parking spot either. Overall great stay had no issues at all, definitely will be booking again!"

Air conditioning unit in the main living area does not work well and it stays warm in that area. Very few towels and bed linens are scratchy and comforter stained. This apartment is just barely “okay” especially for a long term stay. Location is great and very convenient to things.

But now the bad things, all three bathrooms has been so dirty you want even use it, they never has been cleaned the whole week we stayed and there are lots of people using the same bathroom.

Coffee in the morning with a beautiful sunrise, and relaxing in the evening with incredible views of the sun setting over the water and the buildings was the cherry on top! If you're staying in New York City I can't think of a better place to stay than Jamie's! Thank you Jamie so very much for having me!

Even helping by taking cash from us when we needed to get the amount onto our bank card we just simply couldn’t even make it past two nights. The first night we stayed up until 4am because the bed was so unbearable. The mattress is so thin and the metal frame that it is on can be felt through the mattress. We were scrambling to find something else such short notice. There are only two thin pillows to which we put under our backs to ease the pain of the mattress. The common area is much smaller than pictured because there’s no furniture in the photos so I didn’t leave the room or attempt to even cook because I just felt like we’d just be right on top of each other. The floor in the room was very dusty and had a huge stain from someone else spilling something which made me a bit uncomfortable given the current conditions I would hope it was cleaned before our arrival."

You have to use a mini portable heater because the heat radiator does not work. The Roku on the tv is a pretty old version of the streaming service so expect interruptions while watching anything. The back patio is nice in the day... there aren’t any lights if you wanted to hang back there at night, which is probably intentional because one night I had two people with me out on the patio, we were talking for all of 5 mins before I got a text from the host saying the neighbors were making complaints about the noise even though we were having a conversation at normal volume. Overall the apartment is cute, but I won’t be staying again."

"14664","42401212","622053758",2020-04-09,20270841,"Andy","I booked this apartment well in advance of my trip to NYC.  I chose this apartment for location and the outdoor space.  I communicated with the host prior to my arrival, particularly when I realized that I'd shorted myself one day on the booking; Margarita replied it wouldn't be an issue and I could stay the additional day.
The day prior to my arrival I received a message from the host that the current guests wanted to stay longer than they booked.  She asked me to cancel the booking as there are consequences to the host when they cancel.  I began a search for other accommodation in the area, at my price point.  I found flakey hosts who, when asked to book, modified their requirements (one changed the minimum to 30 days after I inquired).  I was unable to find alternative accommodation and Margarita cancelled my booking on the day of my arrival (I was flying from Phoenix to New York City). 
Airbnb's customer service, after many calls and several hours on the telephone found me a hotel room not far from this property.  Unfortunately, they would only cover 3 days (as booked) rather than the 4 days as agreed between Margarita and myself. Still, after many calls and much conversation, Airbnb did step up and cover 3 nights at the hotel.  The hotel had no amenities available. No housekeeping, no food services, nothing because of the pandemic. Certainly not the same as an apartment with a garden and kitchen.
This is my second bad experience with NYC hosts where the booking was cancelled either during or immediately before my stay.  The Airbnb customer service people are limited in their ability to assist.  It was only through much insistence that the finally found me alternate accommodation.  Promises of return telephone calls are empty promises.  Instead they choose to use the messaging system through the app, removing the personal interaction.  
I realize these are strange times and this may have been an unusual situation but when one guest asks for something (additional time in the property) to the detriment of the other guest (with the booking confirmed) it seems to me that the former should be denied rather than the latter.
I've learned to be leery of certain hosts on Airbnb.  The reviews don't always tell the full story.  Stay away from those with cancellation notices.  Although that wasn't the case here, I learned another valuable life lesson through this experience.  Airbnb's terms and conditions appear to favor the hosts versus the guests.  In the future, I will seriously consider other accommodation before booking through Airbnb."

The kitchen and entertainment devices were outdated, there was a single heater that didn’t heat the entire place, the couch needed to be cleaned or at least have the covers changed and there was a smell of urine in the apartment.

We enjoyed the special touches like soaps, kitchen supplies, comfortable furniture, quietness, comfy beds both queen sized, easy parking, 24 hr deli with groceries nearby, and excellent and quick communications. There were even ear plugs and fans, which we didnt need, but it was like everything was thought of. Were I to live in NYC, I would want an apartment just like this one!"

The day before I checked in she asked me to tell neighbors that I was a friend, not an Airbnb guest, if they asked in order to “avoid any issues.” 

I left during the covid crisis partway through my reservation and she said she would refund part of the stay which I really appreciated, but then she said Airbnb was having issues so she couldn’t process it but that she would keep trying. After receiving no response to numerous messages from Tricia I contacted Airbnb who said she refused the refund. 

It was her prerogative to do so, but I don’t have a lot of respect for people who aren’t willing to have honest communication, she could have just told me...and I certainly wouldn’t recommend her as a host."

It was not properly cleaned when we arrived, the bathroom being dirty and dust on the furniture. The host was responsive, but via a (Hidden by Airbnb) group that felt intimidating as a guest.

The location is amazing—a cute neighborhood with several markets, restaurants, a local subway station, and parks within a block of the apartment. Little Italy and Chinatown are only a couple blocks away as well. 
The apartment was cozy,  spotless, well-decorated, and had all the amenities you could need including washer, dryer, dishwasher, pots, pans, utensils, some spices, shampoo, lotion, etc. 
The beds were very comfortable and even included a sound-machine to help drown out the hustle and bustle of a busy city. 
The check-in instructions were clear and the process turned out to be very simple. Pat was great with communication. We experienced an unexpected electrical issue and he was very timely in responses and getting the issue corrected. 

I would 100% recommend staying here!"

This is perfect for one or two people to stay as long as you're comfortable with being cozy. There's a binder left in the apartment with grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, night life both in the neighborhood and Williamsburg. It made getting groceries and coffee on my first day so much easier. The L and M trains are less than 10 minutes walking distance and Uber and Lyft rides pick you up in less than 5 minutes. Even if it's your first time staying in Brooklyn, or New York in general, I think this is a perfect choice. You can double lock your door to the apartment and there's a keypad to enter the building. Plus, there's a security camera inside. As a woman, I felt very safe here."

I left a small frying pan there... thank me later !! The host and his helper were very sweet and nice. He was very accommodating to my check out time and he gave me my space. So that was a super plus for me. Water pressure sucks so it takes away from the jacuzzi. The bathroom could be a little more cleaner. Wasn’t comfortable showering because the curtain was moldy. But overall I liked it and would book again for discounted price lol."

"14809","42477330","623814940",2020-05-03,344745706,"Catalina","Cassy was prompt with response, I found the listing and was able to book within a few hours. My initial Airbnb booking had to be cancelled a day prior and Cassy made it easy to book the beautiful apt on such short notice. The apt was absolutely spotless and offered many amenities along with extra linens, pillows and towels....etc. The kitchen offered complimentary wine and snacks accompanying basic seasonings, utensils, dishware and cookware (an absolute variety). 
 The apt is spacious, yet comfortable where nothing is too far or out of reach. Designed and furnished accurately as it is in the pictures. Nothing deceiving at all, no fake good angles or no furniture from before that’s no longer there. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was so easy and perfect I can’t imagine having anything less at another’s Airbnb. 
 There are multiple grocery stores all a 5 mins walk from the apt and a couple of laundromats also within the same few blocks. Many amazing ordering out options in the area. The location was perfect and mostly residential so it was usually quiet in the neighborhood. The one thing that wasn’t as quiet was some early morning construction that went on nearby, but it was only on the weekend days for a few hours. 
 The apt offers more than what you’ll need in every aspect, except for a sponge (luckily I brought one). I overpacked not expecting the Airbnb to have all that it did (the first aid kit has trauma kits just in case), but this may just be the experience I had at this specific location or all other Airbnb’s where they don’t offer a sponge for washing dishes. Could be they can’t supply different sponges per stays or it’s just something we bring no matter what. This place was so fully equipped with everything and anything I feel I may have just missed where they keep the sponges. 
 Also the skyview windows are no joke. I told my bf to turn off the light and he said he couldn’t cause it was the sun. The natural lighting that comes in is gorgeously insane. You feel like every single light in the apt is on but you’re wasting zero electricity and it’s so guilt free. Most lights installed have the dimming feature which is so luxurious in the simplest way.  I would recommend this apt because it gave me high expectations and standards for any Airbnb experiences I may have going forward. It’s clean, stylish, located perfectly and stocked with whatever you may need."

This place caught my eye because of its location. The place looks exactly like in the pictures, and was super clean. We went food shopping only to find out later that there was so many things in the kitchen we can use. The natural light in this place was amazing! The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were amazing! I’m bummed I forgot to check what kind they were so I can buy myself a pair.

They gave us our space but whenever I texted their response was immediate. The place was a breath of fresh air, tastefully decorated, the kitchen had every utensil and gadget one would need. They wisely left the bathroom in all of its 1920’s Art Deco glory. I enjoyed relaxing on the back balcony where I could see the sea.  It was the perfect escape after the long quarantine. I’m ashamed to say I’ve live in Brooklyn for many years and have never known of this secret gem called Sea Gate, a gated community complete with private (paid access) beach. I didn’t get to the beach but I know if ever I need to get away from my overcrowded Brooklyn neighbourhood, I’ll book some time at Jacks place. Thanks to you both my kids and I regained our breath at sanity at your house."

It was about a 5 minute walk from the subway which is great! The place had some style and felt homey. The host communicated quickly, both before and during our stay. 
The only reason we’re not rating it a 5-star is because the bathtub had bath bomb residue and debris and we decided/needed to clean it, otherwise we wouldn’t have been able (nor would have wanted) to shower there. The host mentioned it was probably pressure from pipe in an old building. 

Other than that, this place was great!"

This apartment offers an iconic New York City experience being surrounded by local attractions, cool bars and boho cafes (unfortunately currently closed because of the city shut down).

The apartment is “petit’” but very well decorated, extremely clean and provides anything you might ever need!

Very functional with its two bathrooms and spacious closets, one for each bedroom.

The host was extremely flexible, easy going and accommodating 

The location is strategic - a walking distance from Financial district, Manhattan and Broooklyn Bridge and Soho. 

The neighbors appear safe and pleasant.

I preferred staying in this charming place and in a neighborhood with a New York vibe as I wanted to avoid the Midtown scenario (banks, phamacies, Starbucks on each corner…)

I am overall very happy with my experience and will definitely try to book this place again on my next stay in NYC."

Me and my group had the pleasure to stay in this gorgeous private townhouse only for 1 night , but the experience was delightful and way above our expectations 

The apartment is gigantic! With tons of light, very big bedrooms and the 4 separate bathrooms, which gave to each of us completely privacy 

The place couldn’t be any cleaner! The kitchen and the common areas fulfilled of any imaginable supply and decor 

We felt at home right away 

Also the host was particularly thoughtful and extremely easy and pleasant to deal with 

The interior are very well furnished and decorated to the very small detail.

I absolutely recommend and I’m very looking forward to come back this beautiful home."

I was very pleased with the area as well, in the historical Theatre district and minuets away from Times Square. There are a lot of local attractions at a walking distance as well as various subway stations.

I'd recommend choosing this apartment over any hotel for a genuine warm & luxurious New York stay. 

Eduardo was very sweet and responsive host, effortless and easy to communicate to.

Overall very happy with my experience <3"

The place is very big, even bigger than the photos 

I felt at home right away, charming, glamorous .. with a lot of beautiful Art around which was a very nice touch!

1 Block from Time Square, but absolutely quite and peaceful 

Eduardo really though about every little single details and nothing was left behind 

I wish my staying was little longer ...

The check in as the stay and the check out was absolutely a smooth process 

I absolutely recommend this beautiful property to anyone who wants to have some luxury and so affordable experience

- 楼很老 在四楼 没有电梯 只有已经开始歪斜不稳固的楼梯 对于需要搬运箱子是很不方便的
- 房源描述基本相符 但是注意厕所是和整层共用的 确实不是很方便卫生 特别是在疫情期间容易感染 这也是我未到退房日期就搬出去的原因之一
- 卫生情况做的一般 入住当天的沙发桌椅床单上就有不少灰尘
- 房间特别小 窗帘不遮光 而且因为房子太老旧 水管声音很吵 有爆炸的响声无法解决 隔壁邻居半夜一直在吵闹 隔音不好 严重印象睡眠
- 长住的舒适度不是很好 室内没有吸油烟机 做饭会很呛 而且没提供任何调料 对长住住户不是很友善 餐桌椅子边缘非常锋利 容易割腿 坐的不舒服 生活消耗品提供不足 只给了两桶卷纸和一瓶洗手液 其他什么都没
- 淋浴间是在房源内的 至少不用和别人共用 但是还是因为房子太老旧 水温特别不稳 永远无法固定在一个合适的温度 一会儿烫一会儿冷 也无法解决"

Although the space is in an older building that could use a little fresh paint, this is quickly forgotten once you open the door and see how big, spacious, and homey the place is (an upside to being an older home). The layout is perfect allowing for privacy between guests, the heat works phenomenally which is important during colder months in NY, and then there’s an amazing little backyard which I don’t believe is listed but definitely worth mentioning. We enjoyed our time outside and were never disturbed by any city noise even though the unit is right next to the Williamsburg Bridge. There’s even a basement with a pool table and plenty of space for exercise! Amenities wise, the kitchen is fully stocked with useful appliances such as a toaster, coffee maker, and electric kettle so we wanted for nothing. Oh! The check in process was also seamless and Maceo & Deea + cohosts were very personable, communicative,  and always easy to reach. Thank you for having us, guys! We look forward to staying with you sometime in the future. :)"

Even though she was out of the country, her communication was excellent. Her place was clean and beautiful in decor. The beds were comfortable, including the sofa bed. Thanks for opening your home, this apartment!  I would absolutely stay at this apartment's again.


This apartment’s apt is exactly as in the photos, modern, clean, comfy and with all the necessary items for our stay. Even a few beautiful upgrades. The bed and couch are really comfortable. We also needed a place to work with our laptops and the desks and chairs did the job perfectly, hi-speed internet was a blessing too.. The walk to the nearest subway station is very close, but you can also take buses or taxis in no time and navigate the city really well. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet. this apartment was a very good host helping us with every detail we asked, even though she was not in town. Restaurants, grocery shops, stores, even museums, etc., are all really close. Overall the apartment and the host were amazing, and we would definitely recommend them."

I had an issue with a different listing and Natalia opened her doors for me and my roommates with no problem. Check in is 5pm, however due to the circumstances I was in, Natalia allowed my group to check in for 8am at no additional charge. The home is beautiful. Theres also a side patio  thats good for sitting out on good weather days. Theres a master bedroom with a bathroom & the laundry room is also in the master. Second bedroom is next to the master which is spacious as well. The room considered as the third is downstairs in the basement however it doesnt have a door for privacy. But my group had no problem with that. Really words cant explain how great this home was. Its also in a great area of Astoria, as many local stores and the train is near.  The only issue we had was cleaning supplies, we were unable to find any so we had to buy a few supplies. But besides that, definitely will recommend and would love to come back."

The location is perfect and within walking distance to so many things. The place was super clean and they even had some eco-friendly products. It took me 20 minutes to get the door unlocked, even with the tutorial, but eventually it did. My only issue was the lack of communication from the host. I am assuming the messages sent via inbox are automated because I had two questions that never got answered. In the end I would 100% stay here again."

The fridge is not new & was uncleaned (not as pictured). The whole unit was unclean, floors were dirty (not mopped or swept), bathroom mat, bathtub & toilet bowl was brown. Very dusty unit. A lot of cleaning products but it seemed like it wasn’t used to actually clean the unit. 

Host provided clean towels, sheets, and pillows."

It was fixed in a couple hours time so nothing in the fridge went bad. Other than that, kinda confusing with where I can put my stuff for bathroom and kitchen but never had a problem. Walls are kind of thin, but don't need to be super quiet at night. All around not a bad experience though. Just some small kinks"

The place was clean and we were be able to cook because the kitchen was well equipped. There was some noise sometimes from upstairs but nothing serious. Great place."
"15019","42629348","624824722",2020-05-15,312402049,"Marianna","The only good thing’s, I can say about Martha and her place, are prompt communication and a convenient location.

The rest of my stay and experience was disturbing, horrifying and made me fear for my safety and security as a guest. And, I repeatedly communicated with Martha, through the AirBNB platform about this, she did nothing to rectify the situation or make good, didn’t even apologize or admit wrong doing.

The place was filthy, 4 roach’s were spotted, throughout stay. The bedroom booked, lacked the comforter seen on bed, so spent first night freezing. The fan and carpet in bedroom pic, were also missing. The couch and sitting area looked different then pics, couch covering was different.

And, my safety was compromised on three separate occasions in 24 hrs. With little to no warning, Martha’s supposed AirBNB partner intruded on the last day of my stay to show the space to perspective renter’s. Martha, only gave me 15 mins forewarning and didn’t bother asking if I felt safe or comfortable with the situation, overall. Same partner, came back again, without warning at almost 9PM to show place to another set of people and ruined my and the other guest with me’s, dinner. He also just marched around and pranced in, used the bathroom, didn’t even ask out of courtesy if it was ok, and had 4 different stranger’s peer into the room, I was renting while my personal belongings were there. I was told by Martha, if his presence bothered me, to stay in my room with the door closed, meanwhile the partner had the audacity to want to show, that room too. Again, without consulting me or asking if I felt safe or comfortable. Final straw, Martha’s partner was parked in his truck, across from the property and deliberately sat there and watched me until I left, to make sure that I left.

Martha is a despicable, disgusting, rude, intolerant, unsafe host who treats guest’s safety, like crap. She is a truly horrid hostess. Never ever stay here!"

From the minute we walked in, it was glaringly obvious that the place hasn't even been cleaned between guests, or if it was, it was with one big dirty sponge. EVERYTHING, i mean even the TVs were dirty with splatter, drips and swirl marks (possibly from the above mentioned giant dirty sponge). All this in Bed Stuy, hotspot of the coronavirus epidemic!!
I wish it was possible to post photos. 
What is even more concerning, is airbnbs lackadaisical attitude, at one point they offered to have the host come over and clean!!!! This is all such a serious health violation and they are offering to send someone who clearly has no concept of cleanliness over to be in the same space we are occupying, and ""clean""??? How about a space being empty for at least 24 hours after every occupant....how about disinfecting a space thoroughly, now more than ever? Not a big concern for airbnb.
I'm writing the review as a caveat for anyone considering booking this place. If you value your health at all, well..... make your own decision."

We were there for 10 days during beginning of Corvid 19 and neighborhood was “open” for business. Kitchen was well stocked for cooking - could use some mixing bowls.  Bed was very comfortable- lots of cushy towels and cleaning supplies. Laundromat is right downstairs and Keyfood was 2 blocks away with a great park in between.

The apartment is great, brand new, even large for Manhattan standards. 39th floor, so there are impressive views of the Hudson River, which was quite the bonus during this stay-at-home period.

Julio was responsive and efficient throughout the whole stay.

We'll be back!"

Plenty of restaurants, deli, groceries nearby that make having an apartment very convenient- as opposed to an expensive hotel stay in the square.

The apt is very clean and cozy, with a full kitchen, comfortable bed, and it is stylish as the picture shown. I love the apartment.

It is in Upper Eastern Side, before the Stay At Home Order, I can run to the central park everyday. The park is only serval blocks from the apartment. There is many grocery stores near the apartment, so it is very covinient. 

Inna is a very helpful and supportive host. Whenever I have some questions she reponse very quickly. The conversation with Inna is quite smooth. 

Next time when I come back to New York, I will choose Inna's apartment again, It is a home for me."

So he met me with a key, no lockbox. He Responds quickly. This is almost a railroad apartment. It is cute but there is some cleaning that needs to be done. There was still toothpaste stains in the bathroom sink when we arrived, hairballs and confetti on the carpet and the faucet in kitchen sink felt dirty when you touched it to turn it on. Im not sure if we checked in right after someone else checked out or what happened but we cleaned a little when we arrived. Fridge is really small so beware of a long stay, don’t bring a lot of refrigerated food. The apartment was cold especially at night, but he had two small heaters and the hot water takes some time to get hot. It looks like they’ve change around the apartment since I’ve stayed here based on the pics so hopefully they got the cleaning done that they needed to."

"15129","42692118","623534314",2020-05-01,89885490,"Austin","All things considered I had a pretty great stay here. Of note, I was a guest during the pandemic and credit the picture window overlooking the city as a critical element in staying sane. It feels more not indoors, but if you open the window and catch a breeze it feels outside enough.
Also appreciated how clean and well-built everything is, the kitchen is great for cooking and although it’s a studio the area is around a corner so you have some separation from where you sleep. Building amenities are quite nice (gym, common spaces) but were closed for the pandemic.
The park at the edge of the water has fantastic views and ferry access is at the end of the pier (highly suggested if you have to head in to Manhattan or Downtown Brooklyn). CitiBike is just outside the door and the building is on the bike/run path if you like to get around that way. 
The neighborhood has convinced me to move here; solid restaurants and good people, just enough of the noise of NYC with all the chill."

For one, when we arrived, every remote in the apartment (for TV's, a/c units, etc) were missing batteries. Also, the internet equipment was sprawled across the living room floor, and the address on the listing did not match the actual address of the unit, leading to some confusion. We we're not made aware of this. 

A few days into our stay, a woman and a real estate agent entered the unit without knocking or us being notified to come ""look at the apartment"". When I let Zac know about this, his response was literally ""thanks for the information"". 

During our stay, the internet went out for a few days, but once I bugged Zac about it a few times, he worked hard to get it fixed.

Other than these problems, the apartment is very nice."

The apartment was sparkling clean when we walked in, with a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. Everything was new, and the apartment was gorgeous and spacious. Melissa had organized and laid out everything for us! There was never a time where anything ran out. She is very thoughtful, communicative and accommodating also. Although the elevator broke during our stay, we weren't even bothered thanks to Melissa's hospitality and help. The location is close enough to the train station for a nice short walk, and far enough so that guests won't be disturbed by noises. The view from the apartment was beautiful, and the quality exceeds the price. We had an incredible stay here, and would definitely want to stay here next time we are in New York."

From the design to the comfortable bed, sofa; from bathroom toiletries to the fully supplied kitchen cookery and utensils, her apt had all the comforts of home. Self-check-in & out with the keypad was a breeze, and made trips in and out to the stores so convenient. Loved the huge wine goblets, they were beautiful. Honestly, everything was so thoughtfully and tastefully appointed, it was a delight to relax, enjoy, and stay in. 

Melissa was extremely kind and expedient in her communication. She seems the type of person that only wants her guests to feel completely at ease and feel welcomed and cared for while staying in her place. I can’t thank her enough for her thoughtful and helpful messages, she is awesome. 

I can only hope to meet her one day to thank her in person, but I will definitely keep her place in mind whenever I am looking to stay again in Queens, as I look forward to booking a return visit soon. Thank you so much again, Melissa! You’re amazing!"

The apartment is beautiful and clean. Smelled fresh as well as being very spacious. Although there’s a lot going on it felt amazing to get away for a couple of nights in what felt like a home away from home. My partner had arrived earlier than I did so Francis showed him around and after the tour he called me excited to tell me how great it looked which had me excited to hop out the Lyft lol. When I came in I felt welcomed and I loved the little sign on the dining table. Let’s just say I’m sure we will be back and I already told my friends they have to go. Again thank you for letting us stay, it’s exactly what we needed."

It’s located in the heart of the Lower East Side—just off Delancey St.—with all the restaurants, boutique shops, and corner stores a person’s heart could desire. It’s in walking distance to full size grocery stores, and about a 5-7 minute walk away from a nearby subway station; which is always a plus in NYC. Because I was there for as long as I was, I got to see firsthand just how comfortable of a place this was, and I wasn’t disappointed. The apartment was very clean, and for a small one bedroom apartment, the apartment is surprisingly big enough to make you feel claustrophobic. This would definitely work for a couple or even a family with a small child. The bedroom gets an abundance of natural light during the daytime, which is lovely, and there’s a fire escape right off the bedroom you can sit on, like I did while there. The apartment has a smart tv, much of what you need in terms of utensils and cookware to make homemade meals, and was well stocked on toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies when I arrived. So even though I was there for so long, I never had to ask for more. But I know if I would have, Christian would have responded as promptly as he did every time I reached out to him. Christian was always very kind when we spoke; and was even willing to go out of his way to accommodate me in his apartment at a discount while I had nowhere else in the city to stay. I highly recommend anyone looking for a one bedroom in the LES to stay with Christian if you can. You will not be disappointed."

But the apartment alone wasn’t what we expected. A few of roach problems and lack of good basic cooking utensils that’s actually functions. The living room is outdated with no TV and a floor pull out couch. The apartment is tiny which is understandable since it’s in the L.E.S and it is NEW YORK. The building entrance was really terrible. It looked like an abandoned building with no front door buzzer; so if you have food delivery or friends or anyone coming over you’ll have to keep making trips downstairs to open. Although, my friends and I won’t stay here again we did make the best of it and the host was polite and easy to talk to."

Near the subway, a lot of coffee options around, within minutes of the Williamsburg Bridge, amazing food staples nearby (Claw Daddy's, Cafe Habana, etc.) and even plenty of nature space to get your fill of some trees in the Summer time. The place itself is very simple but does the job as a comfortable retreat after being out and about all day long! I definitely recommend the space to anyone looking to have a simple yet New Yorker-esque visit to the big city!"

The place was originally a old hotel hence the shared dorm style bathrooms.

The added a cute decide that gave the place an inviting hotel room look.

It's a very central location easy to walk most places.


The neighbors were.... Pretty loud.  I know that's not the hosts fault and in a way is part of that movie cliche authentic experience but ya, I could hear yelling through the walls pretty clearly.

The shower a pretty tight space to work with but let's be honest you can't be too picky at this price range.  At the time I paid 35 a night and it was well worth it. Would definitely stay again."

Which made me feel she was a horrible individual to suggest to someone who only was in their apartment for 15mins . When I complained about the smell she didn’t even off to come and try to fix anything she just went on calling me a liar and theft.

The room was nice and spacious, very clean with brand new towels ready for us to use. The bathroom is also very clean and the kitchen has everything you will need to cook a nice home cooked meal. Victor was also kind enough to leave us space to use inside of his refrigerator and left us an empty cabinet to place anything that may need storage. He also had a very cute  and respectful dog who is a pug, whose name is Once which means Eleven in English. My husband and I are looking forward to staying with you and Once again, God Lords Willing.

Her house is an apartment shared with tenants.I was not aware of this.  The address listed, was not the address we stayed. The house and appliances were deteriorating. Roaches were in the kitchen. During the few hours we stayed, we had the police called on us, was told to leave or go to bed! After we decided we weren’t staying for the remainder of the night, we tidied up and left. Only later to be harassed that garbage was left back and there were too many people. She was aware of the number of people attending. Overall, we will definitely not be going back.

Upon arrival the bathroom door frame was busted out - preventing the lock from working (the space is a common area). It was fixed while I stayed, so that was helpful at least. I was locked out twice— one time from the entire building because someone broke their key off in the lock and the second time from the shared apartment. I was instructed to leave the apartment key under the mat for others to use. Well, I did that, but others must’ve taken the keys. I was locked out for hours one day, after working a 14 hour shift at the hospital, not fun. No one was answering the door and the host not answering for a while via Airbnb messaging. I left after the second time."

It's the most clean and sanitized apartment I have seen in awhile. Everything was sanitized and the place smelled great the minute we walked in.

The place was perfect for my family and I. Each bedroom has a TV in it. The location is amazing too. The kitchen is great for cooking and has a great breakfast bar. The living room offers plenty of seating and great for family time.

I would recommend Jack and Sara's place to any traveler looking for a very large, clean, stylish, home to stay in while in the city. Would recommend for long term and short term stays. Don't think about it- just book their place and you will be happy!"

That is false advertisement and very dangerous! You mustn't advertise a place and say it has a private bathroom but forget too state there is no hot water too take a bath!! You should tell people the truth straight up instead of taking there money under false pretenses!!! What's the use of renting a place and you cant bathe because of no hot water especially during this world wide epidemic that is taking place at this time! I still think I deserve all my money back and the place is not quiet at night because the other guest that  are there are extremely loud after 11 at night no lie!!!"

The lady is very rude she don’t know how to talk to her guest, she replies whenever she wants. The pots are all rusted up that you’ll have to double wash it before using it, n someone keeps walking in and out at midnight which is scary cuz you’ll have no idea on who is it sad part is they don’t have key for the front door instead they left a note saying don’t lock the door, she took the broom and dust pan making it hard to clean up n she don’t clean up everyday and I can’t either because there’s no broom to sweep. Lastly there’s no MICROWAVE. And when I told her, she responded with a screenshot and said it didn’t say microwave, yes it didn’t say microwave but it also did not say no microwave and why won’t there be one? That’s something that needs to be included at all time. But instead she said I should use the over or the stove by putting the food in one of the rusted pot every time I want to heat my food do you know how complicated that was for two weeks that means I spent 99% rewashing pots cuz I needed to heat up food how DISRESPECTFUL"

So i didnt get a check in info. So basically am saying that the host will be at the location or when i call she will let me inside. I text her that am outside and it's raining no response i try to call many times no response. After 3 hours she text me giving me a different address to go to because she dont have hot water. That was a 6.2 miles in a uber from where I was supposed to stay. So I was outside in the rain for over 3 hours before the host send me somewhere else to stay, so I reach where she send me after 10pm. Didnt have a clue about the outcome on this location. When I arrive and finally go inside there is a cooler in the bedroom with beers and leftover food so its look like who was there before me they didnt clean the room. It's up to anyone who travelling if u want to go her place. I was very disappointed how the host was ignoring me."

It felt like a trashed frat house. There were holes in the walls, couch was ripped up, walls, light switches, and cabinets were filthy, missing smoke detector with wires hanging from wall, doorknobs coming off, cabinet doors falling off hinges, missing towel racks in bathroom, lamps missing knobs to turn them on/off, lightbulbs missing from lamps, covers missing from lights in ceiling, half the stovetop worked, kitchen faucet sprayed water everywhere when turned on, bathroom faucet slid all around when you turn on water, dust all over everything, salad bowls used as ashtrays under bathroom sink, no basic kitchen supplies such as salt/ pepper /oil, paper towels, toilet paper. On top of all this, no hand soap or cleaning supplies except for windex during this pandemic. They left 1 half used roll of toilet paper that had fallen into liquid and dried. Absolutely disgusting. My fiancé and I came to nyc to help the hospitals as he is a physician. We were horrified by the condition of this apt and notified them immediately. They didn’t seem to care and offered to have apt cleaned the next day.  We left and they did refund us due to all the photos and videos I sent. Hate to leave a review like this but this was completely unacceptable."

There was a large, open sewage drain in the closet of one of the bedrooms. The smell was awful! Instead of actually fixing the problem, someone came and put a board over the hole that contained a large amount of human feces. 
We were moved to another apartment after the 3rd time sewage backed up into the place because we threatened to call the Health Dept, since we only had 4 more days on our stay, it didn’t make much of a difference. 
We did contact Airbnb customer service with photos, but so far, they’ve done nothing. 
The host, Alicia, is polite and responsive, but all and all it was a terrible experience.

I contacted the host of course but they hardly ever know what to do. After realizing my frustration I finally got a response from the host saying to use another room but the codes provided did not even work which made it more frustrating because the code the host gave me was for yet another room which I wind up using. Finally got settled in and couldn’t even use the bathroom because it was so disgusting and there was no hand soap and hardly any toilet paper at all I had to go out and by hand soap and toilet paper because during these times those things are important. I would not ever stay here again. I was so livid my whole stay. From the minute I got there and saw other guest was in my room and the bathroom being filthy with no hand soap and skimpy toilet paper left was my last straw."

We went to bed after 1am and it was hard to sleep with all the noise from footsteps and closing doors. The bathroom is excellent but the rest of the house is very dated including furniture. None of it matches lol and it’s looks old. It was dusty and the mirror was dirty. There’s barely any amenities (no can opener no bottle opener one towel no wash cloth) tv in the living room is cool with roku but there should be a tv in the bedroom also. It was also cold with no thermostat to adjust, there was little portable heater but it only helps in close vicinity. Overall i believe it’s decent if u just need some space to get away or a quick stay but I think it’s priced too high especially when there’s a cleaning fee and i still had to clean stuff myself as soon as we got in."

An absolute nightmare. I’m not going to go into as much detail again, but it was the worst AirBNB experience I’ve ever had. There were many issues  with the apartment, radiator was  so loud I couldn’t sleep and had to switch rooms. There was a Smell so foul, I think emitted from one of the radiators I had to leave the apartment for 24 hours and air it out. The hosts were not eager to help, and I had to be patient and persistent with them to get anything done. They didn’t want to send the Super or come over to fix anything, and used COVID as an excuse, yet they brought prospective tenants over, without asking. Pathetic. It was extremely stressful, and normally I would have left very soon, which was recommended by people I spoke to, but I had a lot of baggage and I didn’t want to be moving around during the pandemic. I told them I would be vacating 2 days early and then one of them came over and starting cursing at me and trying to throw my bags out. She even called the cops and said there was “an intruder” and I was “being intimidating.” Unbelievable. After I already said I was leaving and had my bags packed. These are not just bad hosts, they are bad people. Fortunately, since they have an illegal AirBNB, they will he shut down."

But she has great rustic touches inside and cute lights hanging from the ceiling. The room directly adjacent is the room of a great singer and piano player. He doesn’t play and song all day but of course he does. So if you’re not comfortable with a bit of noise I’d take this into consideration. The wall is also pretty thin as you can hear complete phone conversations so I’m pretty sure they can hear yours. There are one and a half bathrooms which is really nice. The common areas are pretty huge and rarely utilized by anyone but there (from my knowledge) is no television to be watched in the common area. The kitchen is great but the fridge was pretty packed so I wouldn’t recommend doing real grocery shopping. My only two complaints would be the cleanliness of the bedroom and bathroom. The mats in the bathroom are always completely soaked and it isn’t the best feeling when stepping out of the shower. I did notice the shower curtain was not clean at all and had spots of mold or fungus growing. Other than that this place gets the job done."

I messaged Miss Peaches through the app and was met with almost an instant reply. She confirmed my booking and I arrived the very next day. Checking in was easy and the place was right out of the pictures. It was spacious and clean. I was completely enamored with the kitchen. There are double locks for added safety. Miss Peaches and her family make you feel safe and like home. They also have the sweetest pets! There are minor inconveniences such as the walls being thin so keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper. The bed was also a little uncomfortable so consider bringing some extra blankets. These are little things that not everyone will experience and should not deter anyone from booking with this lovely host! Overall, I had a great experience and reccomend this airbnb to anyone looking for a home away from home."

The space is extremely clean, stylish and roomy for NYC! There's a little outside space on the first floor where we had our morning coffees and got to enjoy some morning sun. My boyfriend and I are both working from home at the moment and had plenty of space and did not feel like we were invading each other's space while working.

It's blocks away from the L train (2 minutes tops) which will take you to Manhattan in 15 minutes. That being said, you can find all the essentials you need around the apartment. There are plenty of delis, grocery stores, and restaurants around. There's also a nice park close by, maybe a 10 min walk from the apartment.

We feel like we've found ourselves the perfect hideout in NYC, and we'll definitely be back :)"

This is a place that is even better than the pictures. The outdoor garden is great; it's so rare to have a private, outdoor space in NYC! The kitchen is fully equipped and we really enjoyed cooking here. The couches and the bed are very comfortable, and can easily accommodate 4 people. Daniel is a wonderful host -- responds quickly to texts and AirBnB messages, bought welcome snacks for us, and was very flexible with check-in and check-out. Again, I highly recommend staying here and enjoying the neighborhood of East Williamsburg."

If your looking for a place more so to just rest your head and be out for the most part , this is a place for you. If you are looking for an apartment that feels like “home” this is not what you want to book. Please also ask host everything before booking !!! Or else you’ll get stuck paying all the fees. He had a third party that runs the apt so please ask everything BEFORE BOOKING!"

We loved free parking, how spacious the rooms were, I had the walk-in closet. 

The washer and dryers are smart machines so was able to use WiFi to start them. And the New York vibe throughout each room was the best.

She provided us with all the information we needed to get around The flat is just perfect! Kitchen is stunning and had all gourmet features. Five burner stove, marble tops, high powered dishwasher. 

Appliances were so brand new. Kinda felt like christmas morning. You could tell we were one of the first ones to stay in the home which was spotless.

The bed is comfortable the spa bathrooms were a dream. Loved the place and was located in perfect spot close to train and with ample parking. Even had a park across the street."

She was so hospitable, check in was a breeze and contactless. The decor is so beautiful and loved how comfortable the beds were. 

The shower is a spa shower and provided soaps and fresh towels. The washer dryer was brand new and she had detergent. 

Parking was a breeze even had a garage. The area is so close to both airports and 5 min from train. We felt super safe and would definitely make this a staple for our trips to NY."

Shower was nice and had the right amount of water heat, but could be hotter (if you like super hot showers). The bedroom has. Television with streaming companies such as Netflix and such, although they weren’t logged into already. I used my own login info and logged it out when my partner and I checked out of the listing. Do the same, and you’ll have no problem. There is a small window in the room that doesn’t have a curtain so be mindful of walking naked to the bath. . Alek was communicable and patient. I was able to check in two hours earlier, and even when my partner and I and Imanaged to get lost and he was STILL very nice and willing to help. There are some times you’ll hear movement outside of the room, but it’s not constant (doors slamming, people waking/talking) but it’s not too much, just be aware. Great stay, great value. Definitely will book again!"

The apt is fully equipped with all you might need to have a great stay. The bed is really comfortable and also if you have some series to catch up, the living room has a huge tv with Netflix :)

I booked this ""aparthotel"" as a place to quarantine after arriving in New York from Los Angeles after reading that my room would come with a kitchenette (perfect considering all of the restaurants are closed). However, I was met with nothing but a counter and a minifridge. Maybe my impression of what a kitchenette should be is wrong, but there was no microwave, trash can, silverware, or even cups to be found. Additionally, as this place doesn't seem to have a staff, I had to reach out to my host, Jeniffer, through Airbnb to ask about the wifi password (not posted in my check-in instructions OR anywhere inside of the building). Not to mention, the thermostat in my room did not work! The self-check-in process was easy enough, but when both of my room keys stopped working there was no easy way to access someone in the building for help— I messaged Jeniffer about this and she told me that a new key would be left for me in the lockbox I used for self-check-in, but when I arrived 15 minutes later the lockbox was empty. To be fair, I was in a testy mood as my bladder was full and there is an alarm in the lobby that goes off incessantly, but still— don't send a guest on a goose chase for a new key. I ran out of toilet paper on my last day and decided I'd rather buy my own than expect help from the people that run this place. Despite all of this, the building has a lovely rooftop to hang out on.

If you need a cheap place to stay without any true amenities, this is the place for you, otherwise, find an actual Airbnb."

Rodeado de sitios hermosos para comer, tiendas, farmacias, todo cerca. 

La habitación es bien amplía, la cama muy cómoda, las sábanas parecían nuevas, todo extremadamente limpio y blanco. El detalle de los libros en la mesa de noche es hermoso, ya que uno es sobre la historia de la calle donde se ubica. 
La temperatura se regula desde la habitación, lo que lo hace comodo y prácticos Tienen un smart tv. La vista desde la habitación es hermosa y les recomiendo también la azotea. 

El baño es buen amplio y tenían muchas toallas. Todo reluciente! 

La cocina también es grande, tiene frigobar, pero no cuenta con platos, cubiertos, tazas o vasos. 
Esto estaba claro, pero les daría un plus y podrían aprovechar ya que tiene mucho espacio, poner un microondas o un tostador, quizás una cafetera o simplemente una jara eléctrica para calentar agua. Eso junto con unos sobres de té o café les daría un plus increíble y mejoraría la vista de la cocina. No es una queja, sino un consejo. 

Recomiendo completamente y voy a volver a reservarlo varias veces."

While my room was quite clean given the circumstances (COVID19), the shared areas - the bathroom and kitchen - were not and ended up being the reason why I left. 

As soon as I arrived, I was greeted by a strong smell and very dirty kitchen. There was food burnt onto the stove and scattered all across the sink and counter. About a third of the kitchen was completely inaccessible because it was being used for storage and the table was also dirty, with bits of food and dried spills on it. The bathroom also had a putrid smell and the sink was so dirty that much of the bowel was black from dirt. I gagged everytime I used the bathroom, and didn't feel comfortable showering or brushing my teeth there. When I reached out to the hosts, they initially responded quickly and assured me that the place would be cleaned numerous times, but said they were having difficulty getting it cleaned because of COVID19. While I was there (3 days), no one ever cleaned the place, so I booked a hotel. After I booked the hotel, Lucy told me the place had been cleaned, so I walked over there to check it out, and absolutely nothing had changed, not even the dirty skillets that were scattered around the kitchen. I was refunded for all nights after filing a complaint with Airbnb, but I strongly encourage asking about the cleanliness of the place before booking."

The property is spread out over 4 stories. The rooftop terrace with hammocks is amazing. I spent the majority of my time there. 

The townhouse is in a nice cluster of similar townhouses. Outside this development, the neighborhood changes. This wasn’t an issue since we were mostly going to the beach and the house. This particular area felt safe. 

There aren’t that many restaurants around and Uber eats options were limited. We knew this ahead of time and brought our own groceries to cook. Also, there’s a grocery store near the train station in case you forget anything. The kitchen had most of the things we needed and it all worked out. 

Overall, it’s a nice getaway from the city. I’d go back here again."

She even baked an extra cheesecake for me which I felt was such a thoughtful gesture. The Air Bnb looks just the same in the photos. This air bnb would have been great if they had a better cleaning staff. The moment I looked at the shower floors I could tell they weren’t clean I tried to run the shower for a while to see if the particles would wash away but they didn’t. Luckily I brought extra sandals so I just used them as shower shoes being that I had no clue what was on the floor. Also there were towels left behind my bedroom door from past guests as well as an old rag left in the shower curtain ring. Other than that the place was great."

The listing states 2 bedrooms , 2 beds & 1 bath , but it’s one bedroom and 1 bed. There’s two mattress on a frame that she advised us to take off one and place in the lounge area as an extra room. Looking at the listing initially you would not be able to know that she had a dog unless you thoroughly look at through the details of the listing. She asked us if she we were either scared or allergic to dogs at the door. She does stay there throughout the duration of your stay with her dog. For an individual looking for a quick space in flushing this would be perfect , just not for me."

Honestly, Danica threw me into a dirty room in the basement with mold in the closet and dirt on the floor, completely different than advertised... I expected wood floors, blue and green painted walls, access to the fireplace. But instead I got white tile floors with white  half painted walls, as if it were an extra room. Complete scam. Meanwhile I paid for 7 days and ended up staying at a hotel immediately canceling.
I waited 4 hours to actually get into the house 1 of those hours standing outside in the cold. I took a picture and a video, outraged to take noresponsibility of the room. Mind you, I paid for the room for the full 7 days but because of the cancellation policy, I received a $0.00 refund.
My theory is she had the room already in use upstairs, and scammed me to get extra money by putting me in an extra room in the basement. Let's not even talk about the roachange killer and dead roaches I saw when I actually looked around (I opened the fridge and there were dead roaches hanging on the door)
I understand it's a pandemic and you might not want to sublet, but don't take my money and not deliver.

It's a 5-10 min walk from the beach but it's also located in a run-down neighborhood. The shower is old, the stove doesn't work, and TV is from the 90s. However, smoking is permitted and you can make as much noise as you want. I definitely won't be staying here again but I look forward to staying at other properties by the same host =)"

I did have a little incident with a chair, I notified Zach and he immediately asked was me and my guest ok. That shows alot! Overall it is a great stay for any local or visitor who wants easy access to the beach boardwalk. I would definitely stay there again."

I haven’t seen an Airbnb like this before! We stayed at the Hem suite, which is a part of the Bond townhouse, and couldn’t ask for a better weekend! This is a beautifully designed 2 BR apartment in a luxury building with a garden. It’s filled with tons of sun light, and is super clean and quiet. I wish I could live here.
The only thing: it is difficult to meet Leonardo in person, but he has a wonderful concierge who had taken care of us the whole time."
